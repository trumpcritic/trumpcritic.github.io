This infrastructure creates the core capacity needed at the state, local, and territorial level to establish and maintain disease surveillance and control of emerging infectious and vaccine-preventable disease threats by building a sufficient and competent workforce, laboratory facilities and capacities, and epidemiologic, statistical, and communication skills. ELC recipients include all 50 state health departments, six large local health departments, Puerto Rico, and Palau, allowing for considerable scalability. For example, resources and technical assistance can easily be pushed to all 58 ELC grantees. ELC also facilitates development of nationwide ELC-funded surveillance systems that are likely to be more cost-effective than discrete and unconnected systems. The EIP`s geographic <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> (10 states across the United States) and EID-funded flexible infrastructure allows it to respond quickly to emerging public health threats. Additionally, EIP and its partners develop and model cutting-edge surveillance and prevention approaches to build and foster specialized epidemiology and laboratory capacity that, along with ELC support of basic/core capacities, enhances local, state, and national infrastructure for addressing infectious diseases. In addition, CDC supports various information systems that facilitate rapid, secure, and accurate information exchange. The information systems serve as a foundation for many of the infectious disease activities supported by CDC, such as detecting changes in the epidemiology of diseases, emergence of new strains, and evaluating vaccine effectiveness.

Non-infectious agents are chemicals or toxins that appear in greater concentration than is safe. These agents can be ingested accidently or end up in locations or products where they do not belong. CDC must respond rapidly as acute toxic poisonings can result in severe or fatal illnesses. In recent years, CDC conducted 15 responses annually, but the number and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> of requests is increasing because of reduced environmental health expertise at the state level.

The project, CKD Health Evaluation and Risk Information Sharing (CHERISH), identified individuals at high risk for CKD. The screening program was conducted in four states in the United States (two sites each in California, Florida, Minnesota, and New York) to optimize sample <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> (e.g., Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans, and Asians/Pacific Islanders). Nearly 900 people were screened and researchers used a history of diabetes, hypertension, or being 50 years or older as the selection criteria. A preliminary analysis shows that the prevalence of undiagnosed CKD is high in this population; more than one-third of people screened based on these criteria had undiagnosed CKD. Researchers conducted a patient follow-up survey and a health provider survey in addition to the screening program. The project is in its final year of data analysis and publication of findings has led to significant enhancements of other screening programs in use in the United States.

At least one in 10 of those affected dies, oftentimes before being diagnosed. Almost half occur during or soon after discharge from a hospital stay or surgery. In FY 2014, CDC analyzed information on VTEs occurring in populations that have age and race <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> using two small and unique pilot projects at Duke University Medical Center and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. In FY 2015, CDC will use lessons learned from these projects to develop the tools and systems needed to identify and monitor efforts to prevent and lower the risk of VTE and associated death. CDC will collaborate with academia and the Veterans Administration to develop an adaptive self-learning tool and Natural Language Processing software that can extract information from electronic health records (EHR) and other data sources to fully identify VTEs that are missed using insurance claims. These innovative methods will allow CDC to provide more accurate estimates of incidence and risk factors for VTE. CDC will also work with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and hospital networks to begin monitoring the effectiveness of healthcare systems-level approaches such as risk assessment tools and EHR clinical decision prompts for preventing VTEs while hospitalized and after discharge.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centers visited the planned 15 communities in FY 2014 (Measure 8.F) to achieve the geographic <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> needed for nationally representative estimates. From 2011-2013, CDC increased the sample sizes for two of its surveys to better monitor changes in the provision of health care, largely through support from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The sample size of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) increased by about 20% from 34,329 households in 2010 to 41,335 households in 2013 (Measure 8.G). For the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), the number of physicians interviewed increased more than 200% between 2010 and 2013 to 11,141 (Measure 8.H.1). Though not meeting its 2013 target, the number of patient records surveyed also increased more than 200% from the 2010 baseline (Measure 8.H.2). The expanded samples provide more precise national estimates for access to care, prevention, management of chronic conditions, and health outcomes. Sample size increases also expand the utility of these surveys by allowing for more state-level estimates from the NHIS and for the first-ever state estimates for some measures from the NAMCS. For example, the NHIS sample size increase allowed CDC to produce reliable health insurance coverage estimates for persons of all ages for 32 states in 2011, 43 states in 2012, and 43 states in 2013, compared to 20 states at the baseline sample size.

Adult immunizations are important to prevent long-term illness, hospitalization, death, and unnecessary healthcare expenditures. Therefore, the Committee directs CDC to find new ways to increase adult immunization rates for recommended vaccines to achieve Healthy People 2020 targets. (p. 57) Action taken or to be taken CDC recognizes that unlike the successes in childhood vaccination rates, adult vaccination rates continue to lag far below Healthy People 2020 targets and racial and ethnic disparities persist. There are many challenges to vaccinating adults, including the <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> of providers and settings in which adults receive preventive services, limited awareness among adults about the vaccines recommended for them, concerns by providers regarding payment adequacy for vaccines and vaccine administration, complexities in vaccine and vaccine administration payment, challenges experienced by many providers in incorporating adult vaccine needs assessment and immunization into busy clinical settings, challenges with vaccine record keeping for adults, and complexities of adult vaccine recommendations. In general, surveys of the public indicate that most adults are interested in vaccines for themselves when they are provided information about vaccines recommended for them; providers of care for adults also are supportive of immunizations; and most adults have health insurance which includes coverage of some or all vaccines routinely recommended for adults. Collaboration and communications among the many providers that adults access for care are essential for improving adult immunizations. To improve collaboration and increase the use of CDC recommended vaccines for adults, the Immunization Action Coalition, the National Vaccine Program Office and CDC co-lead the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit (NAIIS). The NAIIS is a national coalition with over 150 organizations represented, including local, state, and federal public health; professional medical, nursing, and pharmacist organizations; manufacturers and distributors; occupational health and community health; and others. Gaps identified include needs to improve awareness among the public and providers regarding adult immunizations; support for improvements in state and local immunization information systems and their use by adult providers; and identification and reduction in practice-level barriers for providing adult vaccination services. In order to improve provider awareness and routine implementation of adult vaccination services and to improve readiness for emergency immunization programs, e.g. pandemic influenza vaccination, CDC has funded cooperative agreements with American College of Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Pharmacist Association, and National Association of Chain Drug Stores. To improve the public health infrastructure for adult immunizations, CDC has also funded ten health departments (Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Philadelphia, New Hampshire, and New York City) to work with providers, health systems, community health centers, and pharmacies to improve routine vaccine needs assessment and reporting of immunizations to state immunization information systems, and to address disparities in adult immunization coverage in their jurisdictions. CDC also annually evaluates and publishes vaccine coverage rate data on adult vaccinations. Additionally, CDC is currently providing funds to six states (Oregon, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and New York City) to increase use of immunization information systems by adult vaccine providers.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centers visited the planned 15 communities in FY 2016 (Measure 8.F) to achieve the geographic <a href='#' class='text-danger'>diversity</a> needed for nationally representative estimates. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) interviewed 41,493 households in 2015, exceeding the targeted 39,000 households, and nearly matched the 2014 result (44, 552 households). This was due to additional funding to support an expanded sample to produce state level estimates of health insurance coverage. The target number of physicians surveyed by the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) has also declined since FY 2013 (Measure 8.H.1) due to the lack of additional funding. In FY 2015, NAMCS slightly exceeded the target as the survey reached 8,080 physicians. Although the number of patient records surveyed by NAMCS dropped from 111,037 in 2013 to 70,530 in 2015 (Measure 8.H.2), the 2015 results still represent an increase from the 2011 baseline of 33,193. The data from these surveys are critical for monitoring insurance coverage, access and utilization, and other key indicators at the state and national level to inform the public and decision makers.
