The estimated lifetime costs of treating a single person with HIV infection is $402,000. We now know more than ever about how to prevent HIV among high-risk populations and preserve the health of those infected. For example, in addition to evidence that HIV testing can lead to earlier treatment and longer, healthier lives for those infected, recent data have shown that people who begin taking anti-HIV medications early are much less likely to transmit HIV, with up to a 96 percent reduction in transmission risk. A CDC analysis indicates, however, that only 28 percent of those infected know of their infection, are receiving care, and are on therapy that suppresses their infection. CDC has been focusing its HIV prevention efforts on improving the proportion of persons whose HIV infection is suppressed, shifting resources and activities to populations and areas most affected by HIV and to strategies most likely to yield the greatest benefit, including linking prevention activities with the healthcare sector. CDC has shifted the activities, and the allocation of resources for its health department programs. Grantees are now required to spend 75 percent of their resources on a limited set of high-impact interventions, mostly HIV testing, linkage to and engagement in care, and prevention interventions for HIV-positive persons. Grantees are expected to address their local epidemics with these strategies in combinations appropriate for them. CDC has also employed high-impact strategies for its program for young men of color who have sex with men and young <a href='#' class='text-danger'>transgender</a>ed persons, requiring all funded organizations to meet minimum testing targets, HIV-positivity rates, and linkage to care rates for HIV-positive individuals. In FY 2014, CDC will extend its high-impact approach to its main community-based organization program and its capacity building assistance programs through CHIP.

Consistent with the national data progression plan, NCHS conducted and completed field testing of new survey questions in 2012; beginning in January 2013, sexual identity questions became part of the NHIS. NCHS is also working with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to support the 2011 national data progression plan on collection of gender identity data. In September 2011 and February 2012, NCHS participated in ASPE-sponsored listening sessions with the LGBT research/advocacy community to discuss scientifically appropriate methods for obtaining <a href='#' class='text-danger'>transgender</a> data on the LGBT community.

This phase expanded upon the 2012 effort by featuring additional smoking-related health conditions, including people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes complications exacerbated by smoking, and asthma, and included a diverse set of participants representing the following communities: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT), African American, and American Indian/Alaska Native. Preliminary results indicate success similar to the 2012 campaign. The 2013 campaign produced more than 150,000 additional calls to 1-800-QUIT NOW, a number that links callers to their state quitlines. The campaign also generated almost 2.8 million additional visitors to the campaign website, www.cdc.gov/tips. CDC is in the process of evaluating the impact of this second phase of the campaign and anticipates comprehensive evaluation results in mid-2014.

<li>From: <a href='https://trumpcritic.github.io/cdc_budget_pdfs/fy-2017-cdc-congressional-justification.pdf'>fy-2017-cdc-congressional-justification.pdf</a> <br><p>monitoring and evaluating their performance, ensuring programs are implementing high impact prevention and meeting the goals of the NHAS. In 2017, CDC will also continue its support of state and local health departments implementing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and Data to Care demonstration projects for MSM and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>transgender</a> persons at high risk for HIV infection. As CDC's flagship HIV prevention program, increasing the number of persons who are aware of their HIV status and improving outcomes along the continuum of HIV care are prioritized activities. These activities focus on increasing the proportion of persons who are tested, linked to care, retained in care, prescribed antiretroviral drugs, and whose HIV infection is suppressed. This critical HIV prevention program supports strategies most likely to yield the greatest benefit, and has realigned resources to the jurisdictions with the greatest need as determined by the number of persons living with HIV. This funding shift was phased in over the five years of the cooperative agreement and was completed in FY 2016. CDC will extend the current cycle while planning another program cycle. In addition to realigning resources at the national level, CDC continues to work with state and local public health departments to ensure they align HIV resources to better match the geographic burden of HIV infections within their jurisdictions. Specifically, in 2017, CDC will be planning for a consolidated funding opportunity announcement that will foster better integration of HIV prevention and surveillance programs. HIV prevention and surveillance programs will help grantees ensure they are targeting resources to the geographic areas and populations with the highest burden and will also reduce administrative and reporting burden on the grantees. Funding under the current program is awarded in two categories, A and B. Category A funds 61 health departments. Grantees are required to spend 75% of their funding on a defined set of activities with demonstrated potential to substantially reduce new infections:

<li>From: <a href='https://trumpcritic.github.io/cdc_budget_pdfs/fy-2017-cdc-congressional-justification.pdf'>fy-2017-cdc-congressional-justification.pdf</a> <br><p>To support the work of state and local health departments, CDC will fund research on HIV testing technologies and interventions. CDC will also fund efforts that promote testing and the implementation of testing-related guidelines. For example, in June 2014, CDC released updated recommendations21 for laboratory testing to diagnose HIV infection. The updated recommendations, when implemented, allow for the detection of acute HIV infections that would be missed by tests that only detect HIV antibodies, and can expedite entry of patients into care because of reduced turn-around time for test results. In 2015 CDC funded 12 new demonstration projects to address the epidemic of HIV among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) by focusing on prevention services and the continuum of care, and to target health departments in communities with the greatest HIV burden among MSM. These demonstration projects are designed to support state and local health departments in implementing and strengthening PrEP programs targeting MSM and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>transgender</a> persons at substantial risk of acquiring HIV; and implementing Data to Care strategies, which use surveillance data sources to improve linkage, engagement, and re-engagement of MSM and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>transgender</a> persons with HIV not in care. To increase availability and improve utilization of PrEP in these high-burden communities, CDC will support $20 million in additional grant resources for a new demonstration project in FY 2017 build on the first two years of CDC's ongoing PrEP demonstration projects. The new, competitive award will target resources to geographic regions and populations with the highest HIV burden and will allow health departments to use up to 30% of the $20,000,000 set aside ($6,000,000) to pay for PrEP medications as the payor of last resort.

The remaining two grants are funded with HHS Secretary's Minority AIDS Initiative (SMAIF) resources and support implementation of high impact HIV prevention services by state, local, and territorial health departments to reduce HIV infections and improve HIV outcomes for MSM of color. CDC anticipates awarding up to $60 million over a four-year period to seven health departments grantees and $5.5 million over three years to support one grantee to provide training and technical assistance to health departments and their collaborative partners to deliver comprehensive HIV services for MSM of color.
