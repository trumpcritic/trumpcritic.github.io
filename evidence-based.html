Primary activities include identifying health conditions for which people with disabilities are at increased risk. CDC works to assure that all infants are screened for hearing loss by one month of age, receive an audiologic evaluation by three months, and are enrolled in an intervention program by six months of age if a hearing loss is detected. CDC provides national leadership on collecting accurate data on the prevalence of muscular dystrophy and on identifying risk factors for secondary complications. In addition, CDC works to prevent and reduce complications experienced by people with certain bleeding and blood disorders including hemophilia, von Willebrand Disease, thrombophilia, and thalassemia. Primary goals include: 1) enhance blood safety to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases to persons being treated with blood products; 2) identify risk factors through <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> research and surveillance and implement interventions to prevent complications of hereditary blood disorders; 3) prevent and reduce complications of bleeding and clotting disorders that specifically affect women's health; and 4) develop and deliver consistent prevention education messages to encourage affected persons to make informed decisions about their own health care.

Informatics provides new and creative solutions by using information and information systems to address public health problems. In doing so, informatics extends the reach of public health professionals, allowing each of them to achieve more. Public health involves collecting, analyzing, and sharing data that drive <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> decisions with the goal of improving health impact. Public Health Informatics supports these functions and provides new capabilities for preventing and managing diseases and other public health threats to support even greater health impact. CDC's FY 2006 budget request includes the new Public Health Informatics activity to enhance discovery, innovation, and application of public health information and information systems so as to support public health and public health preparedness. The new activity will strengthen CDC's leadership role in public health informatics policy and standard setting, in defining informatics needs nationally, and increase capacities for public health informatics research.

The YRBSS was developed in partnership with federal agencies, state departments of education and health, scientific experts, and survey research specialists. The YRBSS includes separate national, state, and local school-based surveys of high school students. A recent study provides evidence that this adolescent survey has good reliability in measuring health behavior. Baseline data from the 1995 YRBSS are used because: 1) they were the most recent data available when the original measures were created, and 2) they will allow a more accurate illustration of trends in sexual behaviors over time.

The Steps cooperative agreement program, however, cannot exist without the support, infrastructure, and resources established and maintained by the existing state-based categorical chronic disease programs at CDC and within the communities. The Steps program has been established as an extension of these programs to enhance, expand, and create an integrated approach to address the collective goals of chronic disease prevention. The overarching design of the Steps program emphasizes well-integrated programs at the national, state, and local levels; connecting categorical programs to maximize limited resources and accelerate progress toward important outcomes; and basing programs on sound scientific evidence and practice-based knowledge and lessons. The Steps program will continue to coordinate activities at the national, state and community level through shared and integrated staffing, technical assistance and evaluation activities.

The sites are continuing to explore models of care for secondary prevention and management of thrombosis. As evidenced in the development of these sites, CDC has focused on encouraging collaboration between the specialized health-care network and community-based organizations to enhance outreach and education. In moving forward, CDC will evaluate the effectiveness of the specialized health-care system to improve health outcomes and quality-of-life measures for persons with thrombophilia, develop educational materials for patients and health-care providers, develop develop rapid screening methods to detect risk factors for thrombosis and continue to conduct studies to determine risk factors and describe potential interventions to prevent thrombosis.

Such public health information is collected by central and front line staff who need to be trained in both applied epidemiology and laboratory surveillance. CDC works with its partners to design, implement, and evaluate health information systems and to integrate and strengthen existing information systems. These systems measure the status and determinants of the population's health. The information is used to improve the strategies and processes for health delivery and the capacity of the health system to respond to the needs of the community. Modeled after CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), the FELTP collaborates with international partners and the Ministries of Health (MOH) to build the capacity for long-term applied public health training programs. FELTPs utilize instructional design methods to produce their training curriculum. Strategies and content for training activities emphasize three principal areas of competency: applied epidemiology and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> decision making for public health actions; effective communication with the public, public health professionals, and the community; and health program design, management, and evaluation. Training programs are customized in collaboration with local counterparts according to specific situations and assessed needs.

The framework enabled the assignment of Federal Medical Station (FMS) material assets to CDC. These assets will provide an enhancement to the long range planning process, providing defined deliverables, capability/performance characteristics and schedule goals in an ongoing tracking and reporting process. The program is also continuing to develop performance tracking and measurement systems in accordance with CDC's budgeting and performance software database, as is the State and Local Preparedness Grants program.

In fiscal year 2007, REACH U.S. began to include two tiers of interlinked funding: Centers of Excellence in the Elimination of Health Disparities (CEED) and Action Communities. The 18 CEEDs will serve as regional/national resource centers that provide an infrastructure to disseminate programmatic activities in one of five racial and ethnic populations: African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native. The 22 Action Communities will implement and evaluate successful <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> approaches within a specific community. CEEDs and Action Communities will address the key health areas of breast and cervical cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infant mortality, adult/older adult immunizations, hepatitis B, and asthma. In addition, each CEED will train, mentor, and provide start-up funds for at least two "legacy" communities each year for at least three years, to spread and expand the national impact of successful strategies for reducing health disparities.

The program assesses prevention and identification practices among key healthcare providers and evaluates efforts to encourage and improve the uptake of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> prevention activities. Folic Acid: $2,826,000 for Folic Acid efforts aimed at reducing the disparate decline in folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly. CDC uses behavioral health interventions and other nutritional strategies to improve folic acid intake among Hispanic women. Such strategies hold great promise for addressing disparities but may take several years to fully implement and evaluate. Infant Health: $8,028,000 to support CDC`s Infant Health model surveillance and research activities. These projects make active contributions to research and surveillance efforts for birth defects and developmental disabilities. In addition, sites represent models for other participating state and university programs, and facilitate the implementation of quality improvement measures. Specific projects include birth defects surveillance (the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program), birth defects research (the Atlanta Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention), developmental disabilities surveillance (the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program), and the CDC study site for the Study to Explore Child Development.

Teen Driver Safety: $1,600,000 is being used to support a pilot to test the GDL planning guide in six states and to conduct a communication campaign for parents in two cities in the United States. With base funding, a five-year project is being completed in FY 2010 that is evaluating community-based approaches to increasing seat belt use among adolescent drivers and their passengers. Traumatic Brain Injury: $6,152,000 will be used to support TBI prevention, surveillance, and research; the production of materials about brain injury, symptoms, and tips for healing; and resources to educate patients and the community about TBI-related risks and injury prevention. A special focus of CDC`s funding for TBI-related activities is on research related to health outcomes of mild TBI in children and adolescents, the development of a tool for assessing and managing concussions, and the prevalence of a history of TBI in prisons and nursing homes. Support also goes to determining the prevalence and risk factors of TBIrelated disability and other outcomes among children and youth. CDC will continue to support 30 states as part of the unintentional injury program`s Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention Program. CDC`s activities are aimed at better understanding risk factors and evaluating interventions to prevent these injuries. Supporting strategies for translating research into practice and evaluating the implementation and dissemination of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies will move the field of unintentional injury prevention closer to its goal of reducing the enormous societal burden caused by these injuries and deaths. One key challenge in the area of unintentional injury prevention is related to the prevention of falls among older adults. In particular, there is a lack of understanding about why there is an increase in older adult fall mortality rates (30 percent for men and 40 percent for women from 2000 to 2005) even after adjusting for the aging U.S. population. CDC is exploring this area to develop effective interventions.

This section discusses those initiatives; continued activities under the HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB programs are discussed separately, later in the request. In 2011, CDC will begin a focused initiative to prevent HIV through holistic and integrated approaches to protect the health of gay, bisexual and other MSM. This multi-year effort will support the goals outlined in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and will focus on preventing new HIV infections, the acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and substance abuse. This effort will build on plans begun in 2008, when CDC provided $4 million in supplemental funding to 51 health departments to re assess and strengthen their plans to address HIV among MSM in their jurisdictions. It will complement the 2010 expansion of the HIV Expanded Testing Initiative to focus on MSM and injection drug users (IDUs). CDC proposes to support the expansion of effective and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention programs to reduce risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, viral hepatitis and other STIs. Programs include testing, partner services, and condom promotion, as well as social marketing and new media approaches to effectively communicate risk reduction messages.

For example, children living in older housing are more likely to have elevated blood lead levels than the population of U.S. children as a whole. Low-income households and older homes also often have high concentrations of mouse and cockroach allergens. The larger built environment also affects vulnerable populations. For example, a 2006 Institute of Medicine study revealed disparate rates of food security by race, ethnicity, and income. A growing body of research suggests that maternal exposure to chemicals poses a risk to women's health (asthma, breast cancer, and hormonal imbalances) as well as to fetal and child health and development (miscarriage, birth defects, growth restriction, and motor/cognitive delays).

Much of this progress has been based on actions guided by research, the application of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> interventions, and the efforts of occupational safety and health specialists. CDC uses these strategies to improve occupational safety and health. Conducting Scientific Research: CDC develops evidenced-based interventions to reduce work related death, injury and disease as a result of laboratory and field research. For example, CDC research was instrumental in helping to identify the risk of a severe, work-related lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans) in workers exposed to vapors from heated butter flavorings in industrial operations. CDC worked with diverse partners to provide a fundamental base of knowledge about the nature of the hazard in popcorn manufacturing plants, identified the factors that contributed to the risk, designed interim exposure control measures in plants, and assessed the effectiveness of those interim controls. CDC has collaborated with partners to disseminate its findings and recommendations for use nationwide. Moving Research to Practice: To ensure that research has an impact on the lives of workers and their families, CDC works closely with partners to transfer and translate research findings, technologies, and information into highly effective prevention practices and products that can be immediately adopted into the workplace. For instance, CDC, in collaboration with manufacturers, labor, and industry, developed a new personal dust monitor for assessing coal miners' exposure to coal dust in underground coal mines. The monitor provides mine operators with real-time exposure data during a work shift and arms them with information to make decisions to reduce overexposures that might lead, over time, to the development of coal workers' pneumoconiosis or "black lung," a debilitating lung disease. Training: To address the critical need for a multidisciplinary workforce in occupational safety and health, CDC supports occupational safety and health research and education through university-based research; agricultural disease and injury-related research; and through training. These efforts train occupational health professionals and researchers to help meet the increasing demand for occupational physicians, occupational nurses, industrial hygienists, and safety professionals.

By targeting high-risk youth and high-risk populations in general, most EBIs target people who are vulnerable to being homeless or marginally housed. In addition, many of the interventions are adaptable for a homeless population. CDC is currently exploring ways to address broader social and structural issues so that HIV prevention and housing needs can be addressed more holistically.

Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities The FY 2012 budget request of $143.899 million for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities is $273,000 below the FY 2010 level. The FY 2012 request consolidates disease specific funding into three new budget lines: Child Health and Development, Health and Development for People with Disabilities, and Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders. These budget lines represent new comprehensive programs that refocus activities to integrated and competitive grant programs that facilitate more effective approaches. This approach gives CDC greater flexibility to address critical public health challenges and allocate resources to maximize the public health impact. CDC, working with external stakeholders, may continue some existing programs as currently structured, expand others, redirect resources to more effective activities, change the scope of existing activities based on effectiveness and need, and if appropriate, use existing program resources to start new activities or end existing programs.

The Act appropriated $50,000,000 to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide funding for states to carry out activities related to the implementation of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) reduction strategies by: (1) creating or expanding state-based HAI prevention collaboratives; (2) enhancing states' abilities to assess where HAIs are occurring and evaluate the impact of hospital-based interventions in other health care settings; and (3) supporting targeted efforts to monitor and investigate the changing epidemiology of HAIs in populations as a result of prevention collaboratives. CDC was appropriated $300,000,000 in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for the Section 317 Immunization program. Immunization is one of the most important public health tools for preventing death and disability from vaccine-preventable diseases. In the U.S., immunization recommendations target seventeen vaccine-preventable diseases across the lifespan. Despite this achievement, some vaccine-preventable diseases continue to place significant burden on the public`s health. Section 317 currently funds sixty-four immunization programs, including all fifty states, the District of Columbia, five urban areas, the U.S. territories, and selected Pacific Island nations. Activities will focus on four focus areas: (1) reaching more children and adults to expand the number of people vaccinated and thus protected from vaccine preventable disease in the U.S.; (2) conducting innovative initiatives for improving reimbursement, and enhancing the interoperability of electronic immunization data exchange between Electronic Health Record systems and immunization registries to develop specifications to harmonize clinical decision support algorithms; (3) increasing national public awareness and knowledge about the benefits and risks of vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases; and (4) strengthening the evidence base for current vaccine policies and programs, with a focus on recently recommended vaccines. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Prevention and Public Health Fund includes $650,000,000 for <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> clinical and community-based prevention and wellness strategies that deliver specific, measurable health outcomes. In the U.S. today, chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are the cause of seven out of ten deaths and the vast majority of serious illness, disability, and health care costs. Key risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use, are major contributors to the nation`s leading causes of death. In FY2010, CDC launched the Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) initiative to improve access to nutrition, increase physical activity, decrease obesity prevalence and reduce the consumption and initiation of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke through policy and environmental changes at the state and local levels. CPPW will expand the use of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies and programs, mobilize local resources at the community-level, and strengthen the capacity of states.

These funds will promote healthcare quality through the prevention of healthcare acquired conditions, including healthcare-associated infections caused by pathogens such as MRSA, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. It is CDC`s goal to eliminate HAIs in all healthcare settings and to expand public health activities related to monitoring, response, prevention, and applied research. HAIs are a public health problem beyond the hospital, occurring in all settings where patients receive preventive services, diagnostics, and treatment for health conditions. With the increased base funding, CDC will expand NHSN from 2,500 to 6,500 healthcare settings (of which 5,500 are hospitals) in support of the Value Based Purchasing program of the Affordable Care Act Prevention and Public Health Fund. In addition, NHSN participation will be expanded to include approximately 1,000 nonhospital facilities (approximately 500 hemodialysis facilities and over 300 long-term care facilities), where increasing numbers of high-risk procedures are being performed. To ensure data accuracy, CDC will accelerate electronic reporting of HAI data from hospital commercial infection surveillance systems, create national standards for reporting laboratory data for HAIs and communicable diseases, and facilitate more widespread implementation of electronic algorithms for HAI detection. Funds from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will build on the success of the HAI Recovery Act funding in preventing infections through the leadership and coordination of state health departments. ACA funding will support model states which have effectively implemented HAI prevention initiatives through programs and policies. The funding will help these states build on their ongoing successes and invest in sustainable programs that will work across the healthcare system locally to maximize the HAI prevention efforts by collaborating with other healthcare partners such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality improvement organizations, hospital associations, and consumer groups. The collaborations work to implement and ensure adherence to <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> HAI prevention practices to achieve the prevention goals included in HHS Action Plan.

In 2009-2010, tobacco excise taxes were increased by the federal government, 19 states, and Washington, DC. Cigarette price increases discourage initiation among youth, prompt quit attempts, and reduce cigarette consumption (e.g., a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes results in a four percent decrease in cigarette consumption among adults). CDC supports state efforts to use evidencebased pricing strategies to reduce tobacco use. On April 1, 2009, the largest federal tobacco excise tax increase in history went into effect, increasing the excise tax on cigarettes from 39 cents to $1.01 per pack. This tax increase brought the combined federal and average state excise tax for cigarettes to more than $2 per pack, achieving the Healthy People 2010 objective. CDC published a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in 2009 and follow-up report in 2010 on state and federal excise tax increases that generated significant media attention.

In addition, sealants are cost-saving. One study found that sealing a tooth reduced total dental costs over 10 years from $68.10 to $54.60. Program Description and Recent Accomplishments: CDC`s Division of Oral Health works to build and demonstrate the merits of national and state public health core infrastructure and capacity. CDC is recognized for its national leadership in helping states, territories, and other countries collect oral health data and apply new methods for oral health surveillance. CDC is well-known for monitoring the status of community water fluoridation and working to enhance the quality of fluoridation throughout the nation, as well as for training state and local fluoridation engineers and state program leaders on fluoridation theory and practice. CDC provides significant consultation and technical assistance on community fluoridation-related issues nationally and internationally, and also promotes school-based and schoollinked dental sealant programs by translating the science base into practice recommendations and providing technical assistance to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs.

Strong, comprehensive injury and violence prevention programs ensure that states have the capacity to implement and evaluate interventions, that state data are available to guide programmatic and policy interventions, that efforts are coordinated among partner organizations focused on injury and violence prevention, and that state and local policy changes are identified to support injury prevention. Funded Core states also form advisory committees to develop and prioritize injury plans and collaborate with partner groups to advance injury prevention. As a result, several funded states have been able to increase statewide support for injury prevention policies and have data systems that are able to monitor the impact of injury prevention policies. In 2009, the Core program expanded to provide additional funding to several Core program states to implement select <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> injury and violence prevention activities. For example, in FY 2009 and FY 2010 a subset of Core states received additional funding to develop child injury plans and others to address older adult falls prevention by increasing access to effective falls prevention programs, which are often limited due to scarce resources at the state and local level.

This approach is consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS). CDC`s HIV testing program was recently expanded to address MSM as a target population, and the recently recompeted CDC-funded program to support community-based organizations also emphasized prevention among MSM, with approximately half of the funded organizations targeting MSM. CDC will continue to support activities to advance the goals of the NHAS and to reduce HIV incidence and HIV-related health disparities by supporting <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> prevention interventions at the individual, community, and structural levels. CDC's National Act Against AIDS campaign is raising awareness of the continued impact of HIV on MSM health and promoting HIV testing and risk reduction. In addition, the FY 2012 request aims to expand the reach and impact of HIV prevention activities for MSM by supporting demonstration projects that will employ cost effective <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> approaches to reduce HIV incidence, improve the sexual health of MSM, and conduct research to develop and test innovative prevention interventions.

Effective tobacco control programs, implemented through evidencebased tobacco control policies, significantly prevent and reduce tobacco use. Through the implementation of its National Tobacco Prevention and Control program, CDC made significant progress in decreasing the burden of tobacco-related death and disease. Although cigarette use remains largely static in recent years, the percentage of adults that are current smokers increased in 2009 to 20.6 percent, but declined to 19.4 percent in 2010, thus achieving the target (Measure 4.6.3). Additionally, the per capita cigarette consumption among adults in the United States declined from 1,507 to 1,281 between 2008 and 2010 (Measure 4.6.2). The proportion of youth cigarette use significantly declined from 1997 to 2003, however it has since stalled. In 2009, the percent of adolescents (grades 9 through 12) who reported current cigarette use was 19.5 percent (Measure 4.6.5).

The estimated lifetime costs of treating a single person with HIV infection is $402,000. We now know more than ever about how to prevent HIV among high-risk populations and preserve the health of those infected. For example, in addition to evidence that HIV testing can lead to earlier treatment and longer, healthier lives for those infected, recent data have shown that people who begin taking anti-HIV medications early are much less likely to transmit HIV, with up to a 96 percent reduction in transmission risk. A CDC analysis indicates, however, that only 28 percent of those infected know of their infection, are receiving care, and are on therapy that suppresses their infection. CDC has been focusing its HIV prevention efforts on improving the proportion of persons whose HIV infection is suppressed, shifting resources and activities to populations and areas most affected by HIV and to strategies most likely to yield the greatest benefit, including linking prevention activities with the healthcare sector. CDC has shifted the activities, and the allocation of resources for its health department programs. Grantees are now required to spend 75 percent of their resources on a limited set of high-impact interventions, mostly HIV testing, linkage to and engagement in care, and prevention interventions for HIV-positive persons. Grantees are expected to address their local epidemics with these strategies in combinations appropriate for them. CDC has also employed high-impact strategies for its program for young men of color who have sex with men and young transgendered persons, requiring all funded organizations to meet minimum testing targets, HIV-positivity rates, and linkage to care rates for HIV-positive individuals.

CDC translates research into innovative prevention strategies and tools to bring the latest scientific findings to communities. Together, CDC's <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> chronic disease programs reach millions of Americans to improve health and prevent disease. CDC requests authority to allow CDC and grant recipients to reallocate up to five percent of grant funds across the selected chronic disease prevention and health promotion activities to enhance coordination and strengthen collaborative work across activities. Because chronic diseases and their risk factors share many social, environmental, behavioral, and biological determinants and are often managed by the same or similar organizations, health promotion and prevention efforts require significant collaboration. This collaborative orientation allows grantees the flexibility needed to maximize resources and structure programs in a more comprehensive manner.

The program emphasizes <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> screening promotion activities to increase population-level screening rates, while providing limited direct screening services to underserved people. Grantees work with various healthcare systems, workplaces, and insurers to improve and increase delivery of colorectal cancer screenings. Approximately two-thirds of funding is used to implement colorectal cancer screening promotion practices such as small and mass media, client/provider reminders, patient navigation, and provider assessment and feedback. Up to one-third of program dollars are used to provide cancer screening and diagnostic follow-up services to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured men and women age 50 to 75. Since program inception in 2009 through December 2011, CDC-funded programs have screened 19,899 clients, diagnosing 50 colorectal cancers and 2,917 cases of pre-cancerous polyps.

Numerous barriers to screening exist, including patient factors such as income, education, and lack of awareness; and provider or clinical system factors such as lack of physician availability or appropriate physician recommendation. CDC surveillance and research have documented that current screening rates are too low for certain disparate populations that may have access to coverage but encounter these other barriers. In 2014 and beyond, CDC's cancer screening programs will complement the benefits provided through the ACA by building upon their extensive capacity and existing linkages with the clinical care system to increase cancer screening on a population level while still providing direct services to the most vulnerable in the areas where it is not covered by insurance. The CRCCP will serve as a model that uses <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> screening promotion practices along with targeted screening provision to increase screening rates population-wide. The Budget transitions funding for activities that are provided by insurance and focuses on linkage to care, which is more aligned with CDC's mission.

Preventing new HIV infections is achievable and critical to stem the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, even in the absence of an HIV vaccine. To accomplish this goal, CDC focuses on scaling up three pivotal evidencebased interventions: antiretroviral therapy (ART), preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMM)/ !RT reduces an HIV positive persons viral load, reducing the risk of sexual transmission to a partner by up to 96%. The use of appropriate antiretroviral medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission to less than five percent. onclusive scientific evidence shows that circumcision reduces mens risk of HIV acquisition from heterosexual exposure by at least 60%, with numerous additional benefits for themselves and their partners. When scaled-up and used in combination, these three interventions offer a historic opportunity to drive down the worldwide rate of new HIV infections and advance towards achieving an AIDS-free generation.

Due to changes to the BRFSS sample for calendar year 2011 data, which includes the addition of a cell phone sample and revised weighting methodology, results for this measure from 2010 and earlier should not be compared or combined with data from 2011 and later. Funded states are implementing comprehensive, <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> programs that target health care providers and asthma educators in multiple settings (doctors offices, hospitals, schools, daycare centers, community organizations) to ensure they are aligning their efforts with the National Institute of Healths Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.

In FY 2014, CDC received 1,339,561 page views on the Community Guide website, an increase of 44% over the 2011 baseline, nearly achieving the FY 2014 target. CDC maintained the majority of expected page views by utilizing processes, strategies, and web-based products developed and tested during 2011-2013. CDC expects modest growth in page views in FY 2015 through FY 2016 due to the release and promotion of enhancements to the Community Guide website (developed in 2012-2014) that provide customized decision and implementation support for a range of user audiences.

Creating an AIDS-free generation is a policy priority for the United States. Preventing new HIV infections is achievable and critical to stem the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, even in the absence of an HIV vaccine. To accomplish this goal, CDC focuses on scaling up three pivotal <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> interventions: antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). ART reduces an HIV positive persons viral load, reducing the risk of sexual transmission to a partner by up to 96%. The initiation of lifelong antiretroviral medication for pregnant women leads to the virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission and improves mothers health/ Conclusive scientific evidence shows that circumcision reduces mens risk of HIV acquisition from heterosexual exposure by at least 60%, with numerous additional benefits for themselves and their partners. When scaled-up and used in combination, these three interventions offer a historic opportunity to drive down the worldwide rate of new HIV infections and advance towards achieving an AIDS-free generation.

Results showed that more than 70% of ACTs went to clients who did not have malaria, and less than a third of clients who had the disease bought the medication. This study prompted the Global Fund and the Tanzanian government to implement policy changes to increase access to rapid diagnostic tests and subsidized treatment for people with malaria.

The application of dental sealants on permanent molars soon after they appear (generally around 6 years of age) reduce decay in these teeth by 81% approximately 2 years after placement. DOH supports school based sealant programs that target schools with high populations of low-income children who are higher risk of dental decay. We also support states who provide oral health education and fluoride varnish application to younger children, however, there are currently no population based strategies (other than fluoridation) for children under five and pregnant women that have an evidence base of effectiveness.

CDC is committed to supporting populations that experience the greatest disparities in health status. The request will fund the most effective and evidence based REACH programs. REACH will award a new cooperative agreement in FY 2017 that will incorporate lessons learned from prior community grant programs, resulting in a stronger, more robust REACH that builds on the growing evidence base. CDC will simultaneously launch a national evaluation of REACH 2017 to ensure standardization and consistency across communities. Components of this evaluation could include: economic analyses, clinical data extraction from electronic medical records, and the modification of existing BRFSS indicators. Prostate Cancer (-$13.2 million) The FY 2017 budget request eliminates funding for prostate cancer activities. While the evidence on prostate cancer screening remains unclear, CDC has conducted extensive research and developed materials to help doctors better communicate with their patients about informed decision making related to prostate cancer screening and treatment. The proposed elimination will not impact CDC's ability to collect data on national prostate cancer incidence through the National Program of Cancer Registries. Environmental and Health Outcome Tracking (-$10.0 million) The FY 2017 request includes a decrease of $10.0 million for Environmental and Health Outcome Tracking activities. The FY 2017 budget request maintains core tracking network activities and functions, but funding and assistance to states will be reduced. CDC will focus on capacity building for existing grantees to ensure that public health actions based on these data continue. Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness (-$8.2 million) The FY 2017 budget request reflects the elimination of the Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness. CDC will continue to support research and training for public health preparedness through the public health preparedness and response research agenda. Eliminating funding for these centers allows CDC to prioritize funding for state and local health departments through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (-$5.4 million) The FY 2017 budget request reflects the elimination for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

In clinical research, studies funded through the TB Trials Consortium (TBTC), CDC and other partners are seeking to shorten TB treatment and address the significant limitations of current therapies--including harmful side effects--and improve therapy for children, persons with HIV infection, diabetes, other co-morbidities, and drugresistant TB. In 2011, CDC published results from a major TBTC study showing that once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 3 months (3HP) by directly observed therapy (DOT) is safe and effective for treating LTBI. While the 3HP regimen is remarkably shorter than the standard 9-month isoniazid regimen for treating LTBI, implementation of 3HP is limited by the requirement for DOT. Models show that the regimen would be cost effective with Self-Administered Therapy (SAT) even if the treatment with SAT were lower. In 2015 CDC presented preliminary findings from the iAdhere study (TBTC Study 33), which was conducted in the United States and several international settings and compared 3HP completion rates by DOT versus SAT or enhanced SAT with weekly text reminders (eSAT). Findings from a pre-specified analysis limited to the United States only, support use of 3HP by SAT in the United States. However, further cost-effectiveness analyses and evaluation of the role text reminders are needed. In addition to clinical trials, CDC supports the TB Epidemiologic Studies Consortium (TBESC), which applies epidemiologic, behavioral, economic, laboratory, and operational research to improve programmatic efforts in TB elimination. TBESC focuses on approaches to diagnosing and treating people with LTBI to prevent future cases of TB disease. CDC develops and conducts innovative laboratory tests including advanced molecular detection methods that serve the diagnostic needs of TB programs in the United States. CDC's surveillance for Large Outbreaks of TB in the United States (LOTUS) is one example of innovative use of advanced molecular detection. This system, which completed its pilot year in 2015, identifies large TB outbreaks based on analysis of genotyping data and reports from programs. From April 2014 to April 2015, LOTUS surveillance led to the detection of 16 confirmed, probable, or suspected TB outbreaks in the United States. CDC found that half of probable and confirmed outbreaks were detected through genotyping alone, and not reported by programs. In large, complex outbreaks, CDC uses whole genome sequencing to distinguish between closely related strains of TB, allowing epidemiologists to pinpoint how TB is being transmitted within communities with a high background burden of TB disease. The enhanced "picture" of TB transmission that results from whole genome sequencing enables health departments to scale their responses and allocate resources to address ongoing TB transmission. A consequence of fewer TB cases in the United States has been less funding and public support for TB programs and an unstable U.S. supply of TB drugs. Anti-TB drugs are old, and the drug supply for TB is dependent upon a handful of U.S. pharmaceutical companies who produce drugs with varying shelf lives and storage requirements. Interruption in the supply of any biologics or drugs used in diagnosing or treating TB impacts nearly every domestic TB program. TB drug interruptions put the United States at risk for longer and more costly outbreaks, and ultimately for another resurgence, rolling back decades of progress and putting additional Americans at risk of a preventable and curable disease. CDC, FDA, USAID, U.S. drug manufacturers, and international partners work together to inform TB programs of impending shortages, and try to locate FDA-approved TB drugs and biologics for U.S. TB programs. CDC also continues to support improvements in effectiveness and efficiencies that can be gained through integrated services encouraging grantees to address related infections and to develop capacities that can be shared across programs, including HIV, STD, and viral hepatitis. CDC continues to address global TB through control and prevention activities. Funding for international TB efforts are described in the Global Health narrative under Tuberculosis.

The following sections describe select core infectious disease activities. Vector-Borne Diseases CDC's vector-borne diseases program63 is the focal point of the nation's capacity to detect, control, and prevent bacteria and viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. CDC experts combine support to state and local health departments with field investigations and intramural research, addressing risks to the United States from emerging and invasive pathogens arising anywhere in the world.

Support for these cooperative agreements comes from multiple budget sub-lines. This approach allows each program to have a greater reach across states, reduces duplication and redundancy, and delivers public health value on each disease- and risk factor-specific budget line. State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments--the primary implementers of CDC's chronic disease programs--increasingly organize their programs functionally, aligning with the four domains to address many diseases and risk factors simultaneously. As such, this approach results in cross-population improvements in health, with greater gains in population subgroups, ultimately accelerating progress in achieving national health outcomes.

CDC has embraced the development and implementation of a comprehensive set of public health approaches to promote and improve the health of people with blood disorders. These public health activities seek to use proven interventions for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and hemoglobinopathies to mitigate adverse health effects. Additionally, these approaches attempt to develop and implement interventions that benefit the entire community of people affected by blood disorders. VTE245 is a serious but preventable condition that includes blood clots in the legs and life-threatening clots in the lungs. It affects an estimated one million Americans each year with annual healthcare costs of up to $10 billion. At least one in 10 of those affected dies, oftentimes before being diagnosed. Almost half of VTEs occur during or soon after a hospital stay or surgery; these are known as healthcare associated VTE (HA-VTE). Throughout FY 2015, CDC is using lessons learned from these projects to inform what intervention strategies are needed to lower risk and continue efforts to monitor HA-VTE and prevention efforts. In FY 2015, the National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA) has worked to identify and fill VTE awareness gaps with existing and new tools, launch a digital and social media awareness campaign to improve patient-healthcare professional dialogue, and mobilize an e-patient brigade to drive grassroots efforts that will expand and sustain the program locally. In FY 2016 and FY 2017, CDC will use the findings from the VTE pilot projects to fund new, targeted prevention activities that aid in CDC's comprehensive public health approach to preventing morbidity and mortality associated with VTE. CDC will continue the support of the National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA) and address the Healthy People 2020 Blood Disorders and Blood Safety focus area,246 which includes reducing the number of adults who develop a VTE in hospitals and increasing the proportion of persons with hemoglobinopathies who receive <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> recommended treatments to prevent complications. Sickle Cell Disease247 (SCD) is one of the most common inherited red blood cell disorders. SCD affects 90,000 to 100,000 people in the United States, causing episodes of severe pain, organ damage, serious infections, stroke, and repeated hospitalizations. People with the most severe form of SCD have a life expectancy 20-30 years shorter than people without SCD. It is estimated that up to 80% of hospitalizations for SCD are paid for by public insurance programs like Medicaid or Medicare. An estimated three million additional Americans have sickle cell trait248 (SCT) which means that a person has inherited the sickle cell gene from one of his or her parents. The trait can be passed onto their offspring, putting a new generation at risk for SCD. While SCT is present in diverse ethnic groups, it is most common in blacks and affects one in 12 blacks in the United States. In an effort to ensure high quality care for individuals affected by SCD and SCT, CDC supports providing technical assistance on the development and implementation of a public health awareness campaign and education program for SCD and SCT to increase knowledge and understanding of sickle cell, encourage everyone to know his or her SCD and SCT status, and provide information about where to get tested.

The Community Guide Decision-makers in communities, businesses, healthcare institutions, and public health agencies at the local, state, and federal level rely on recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force)297 when they want to know what works to improve and protect population health. Task Force recommendations, which are based on rigorous systematic reviews of all available evidence and compiled in The Guide to Community Preventive Services (The Community Guide)298, identify programs, services, and policies proven effective in a variety of real-world settings--from communities and counties to worksites, schools, and healthcare systems to reduce future demand for healthcare spending that is driven by preventable disease and disability and to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the U.S. workforce. Community preventive services evaluated by the Task Force include informational and education programs and services, programs to support healthful lifestyles, organizational and public policies, changes to the built environment, and health systems interventions. CDC is directed by statute (Public Health Services Act  399U) to provide ongoing administrative, research, and technical support for the operations of the non-federal, nonpartisan, independent, unpaid Task Force. In support of the Task Force, in FY 2015, CDC completed systematic reviews of effective programs, services, and policies for preventing high-priority public health problems including cardiovascular disease, health equity, and vaccinations. These systematic reviews form the basis for Task Force recommendations. CDC also provided technical assistance and support, as requested, to a wide range of users including state health departments, local health agencies, public health, healthcare organizations, community based organizations, and other healthcare providers in 27 different states to help them identify and implement Task Force recommendations that meet their particular needs. Communities across the country are choosing to implement <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> recommendations from the Task Force that meet their specific needs to make their communities safer and healthier.

CDC launched the National Asthma Control Program in 1999 to address the rising prevalence of asthma. In the United States today, nearly 26 million people have asthma, including seven million children. The disease disproportionately affects African American children, who are twice as likely to be hospitalized and over four times more likely to die from asthma than white children. The National Asthma Control Program seeks to decrease the number of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and reduce limitations on activity, including school days or workdays missed due to asthma. Budget Request CDC's FY 2017 request of $29,000,000 for the National Asthma Control Program is level with the FY 2016 Enacted level. Requested funds are needed for CDC to lead a coordinated public health effort to understand and address asthma in the United States. In addition, these funds support projects on indoor and outdoor air pollution to better understand and evaluate the effects of air pollution on people with asthma. Expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act allows more people with asthma to access healthcare providers and medication, and CDC supports critical components of comprehensive asthma control. In FY 2017, CDC will continue to offer education and expertise to inform public health action, quantify risks and vulnerabilities to asthma control, and provide funding to state health departments to implement comprehensive asthma control programs. Implementing a Comprehensive Approach Comprehensive asthma control aligns the full array of asthma care services across the public health and healthcare sectors so that people with asthma receive all of the care that they need. CDC implements a tiered approach to asthma control, using asthma interventions with the strongest evidence of effectiveness, delivered as a comprehensive package. For people with asthma, a comprehensive approach assures availability of and access to guidelines-based medical management338 and appropriate medication use. For those whose asthma remains poorly controlled, additional steps progressively provide more individualized services, such as selfmanagement education, school- and home-based trigger (e.g., dust and cockroaches) reduction, and other environmental management strategies. Monitoring Asthma Trends Asthma surveillance is the collection of asthma data at both the national and the state level. Data collection is important to understand asthma trends and identify people who are most at risk of developing asthma or having asthma-related illness. National data sources for asthma include CDC's National Health Interview Survey and Vital Statistics System. CDC epidemiologists use these surveillance systems to analyze asthma prevalence, activity limitation, days of work or school missed, rescue and control medication use, asthma self-management education, physician visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations due to asthma, and deaths due to asthma. CDC surveillance systems also provide state-specific asthma data. State-specific adult and child asthma

Using a public health approach, CDC provides national leadership in understanding the causes of violence and how to prevent harm. CDC works closely with other government agencies, including those within the U.S. Department of Justice, to comprehensively address the risk factors for violence. CDC experts collect and review data on violence, help assess the effectiveness of policies and programs, and issue guidance on <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> violence prevention interventions. CDC implements violence prevention interventions through state and local public health agencies, universities, and non-governmental organizations. Recognizing the important role that states have in violence prevention, CDC improves the ability of state health departments to track trends, implement effective interventions, and share successes.

More than one million women report being raped each year and one in five women report having been raped in their lifetime. One in 59 men report having been raped in their lifetime. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are preventable. That is why CDC promotes healthy relationships and supports rape prevention in coordination with state and local partners. The RPE program funds health departments in states, territories, and Washington, D.C. to work with rape crisis centers, state sexual assault coalitions, and others to advance the primary prevention of sexual violence. The RPE program supports implementation of proven, culturally relevant rape prevention and education activities. In FY 2014, CDC began a five-year cooperative agreement cycle for all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four territories. Award amounts were determined based on population after providing base funding of $150,000 per state or $35,000 per territory. Grantees use CDC funding to operate state and community hotlines, implement statewide sexual violence prevention plans, and address local needs. For example, several state health departments are using CDC funding to conduct seminars on college campuses to reduce sexual assault and create a culture where sexual violence is not tolerated. In FY 2016, CDC will use the increase of $5.6 million to improve sexual violence prevention nationwide and to allow CDC to fund a maximum of five academic or research institutions to evaluate promising prevention strategies emerging from the field. A portion of the funding will also support a robust program evaluation that will feature improved performance monitoring, enhanced data collection, and an outcome evaluation to measure the RPE program's effects on intermediate indicators, health outcomes, and rates of sexual violence. CDC's rape prevention grantees collect data and scientifically evaluate their programs to build the evidence base in sexual violence prevention and scale up <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> efforts throughout the RPE program. In FY 2017, CDC will award the fourth year of funding in this cycle to 55 grantees. Evaluation of rape prevention programs is critical to reducing sexual violence in the United States. Public health needs evidence of what interventions work best for a given audience in a given location. CDC continues to support four studies to evaluate promising sexual violence prevention strategies. Three of these studies (which take place in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) focus on engaging young men in prevention. The fourth study is evaluating a bystander prevention program among high school youth in New Hampshire. In FY 2017, CDC will solicit research proposals focused on prevention of teen dating violence, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence.

Funded state health departments are implementing strategies based on the best available scientific evidence to improve child well-being and to prevent child maltreatment. Additionally, over 30 unfunded states have elected to participate in Essentials for Childhood, with more limited engagement, due to high interest in the initiative.

Almost two-thirds of ACE Study participants reported at least one ACE, and more than one in five reported three or more ACEs. The short- and long-term outcomes of these childhood exposures include a multitude of health and social problems, such as suicide attempts, alcohol abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and elevated risk for intimate partner violence. NATSCEV is the first comprehensive effort to measure children's exposure to multiple forms of violence in the home, school, and community across all age groups, and the first attempt to measure the cumulative exposure to violence over a child's lifetime. Findings have influenced the development of the U.S. Department of Justice's Defending Childhood initiative and inform CDC's ongoing work with the ACE Study. CDC recently concluded a three-year demonstration project in two sites of Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, an <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> system of interventions that enhances parental knowledge, skills, and confidence to prevent behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children. Findings included that local health departments have the community connections, staff capacity, broad portfolio of services, and flexibility needed to coordinate Triple P implementation. Youth Violence Prevention Preventing Violence in Early Adolescence In FY 2017, CDC will support communities (through their respective local health departments) to prevent multiple forms of violence affecting children in early adolescence, including peer-to-peer violence, teen dating violence, sexual violence, and bullying. This program will focus on the implementation of comprehensive prevention strategies targeting youth in low-income, high-crime cities and metropolitan areas with the greatest number of adolescents at increased risk for violence. Awardees will focus on prevention activities for 11-14 year old youth in high-risk communities, implementing <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies to prevent interpersonal violence, including effective implementation strategies identified by CDC's Dating Matters and Striving to Reduce Youth Violence Everywhere (STRYVE) initiatives. This program will build on successes achieved through CDC's Dating Matters and STRYVE projects. Through Dating Matters, over 10,000 youth received dating violence prevention curricula in the 2013-2014 school year, in conjunction with parent and educator training, and over 800 educators have completed surveys on school climate and dating violence in their schools. STRYVE cities implemented evidence based programs such as YES, an after-school program that provides opportunities to learn specific skills, practice those skills, and helps youth establish the social and cognitive resources that will help them effectively navigate and change their social interactions. Evaluations of these and other programs-- including <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> or evidence-informed programs that demonstrate the potential to impact multiple forms of violence, including teen dating violence and youth violence will inform future activities in this area. National Centers of Excellence in Youth Violence Prevention In FY 2015, CDC funded five universities to serve as local, regional, and national resources for developing and applying effective violence prevention strategies in communities. These National Centers of Excellence in Youth Violence Prevention (YVPCs, formerly Academic Centers for Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention) receive funding through competitive, five-year cooperative agreements, currently serving the communities of Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Flint, Michigan; and Louisville, Kentucky. In FY 2017, CDC plans to continue to fund a total of five YVPCs for the next funding cycle. CDC will continue to work with the YVPCs to build communities' capacities to implement <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> youth violence prevention strategies. Universities, because of their strong local ties and academic resources, provide unique opportunities to work within communities to prevent violence.

The program supports 20 state health departments to strengthen injury surveillance programs and effectively develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate violence and injury prevention programs and policies based on the best available evidence. These state-based programs protect their residents by putting science into action to save lives and prevent injuries. All 20 currently funded states receive funding for the base integration component. This component allows states to focus on four priority areas selected based on state needs, while also requiring essential activities--such as surveillance and evaluation--to ensure program effectiveness. States receiving base integration component funding also were eligible to compete for additional funding through expanded Core VIPP components. The expanded components described in the table below were effective for the FY 2011-FY 2015 funding cycle and will be revised under the new funding opportunity announcement to be awarded in FY 2016.

CDC also will focus on improving the safe mobility of older adults by working to better understand the transition from driving to not driving. For instance, CDC is developing a tool for older adults allowing them to quickly assess their current mobility and obtain actionable, tailored feedback on steps they can take to make mobility changes. For tribal motor vehicle injury prevention, CDC is developing a manual of best practices from CDC's successful Tribal Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Program (TMVIPP), which will be released in early 2016. The manual will serve as a resource to tribes on what works to prevent motor vehicle injuries among American Indians and Alaska Natives, a population that has 1.5 to 3 times higher rates of motor vehicle injury and death than other Americans. Best practices included in the manual may help to inform activities undertaken by tribal communities in coordination with the proposed expansion of the Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country initiative, a primary aim of which is to decrease the incidence of alcohol-related motor vehicle injuries within tribal communities. To further amplify the implementation of TMVIPP practices, CDC is working to increase the reach and impact of the TMVIPP lessons learned by partnering with the FHWA to reach more tribes through FHWA's Tribal Technical Assistance Programs. This partnership will allow CDC to provide technical support, training, and other activities that will reduce motor vehicle-related fatalities and injuries in Indian Country and will reach up to 37% of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States. CDC also will continue to guide states by providing expert feedback on planned activities and implementation strategies through Core VIPP. This work is vital since all 20 Core VIPP states identified motor vehicle injury prevention as a priority area. This guidance will build on previous successes, encourage the use of evidencebased interventions, and help states use data to inform decisions. Suicide Surveillance, Research, and Prevention CDC provides national leadership in understanding who commits suicide and why and how to prevent suicide and its risk factors. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States among all age groups and is estimated to cost $41.2 billion in combined medical and work loss costs.374 With FY 2017 funding, CDC will expand efforts to prevent suicide by improving surveillance, research, and the development and evaluation of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies. CDC will continue to expand resources and support for fatal and non-fatal surveillance systems for self-directed violence, including collection of data at the national, state, and local levels, which leads to more relevant information for decision makers at the state and local levels. This important data and research will help CDC determine the effectiveness of strategies to prevent suicidal behavior and expand the number of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> prevention activities. CDC is continuing efforts to evaluate two interventions--LET's CONNECT and The Senior Connection--to promote and strengthen individual, family, and community connectedness, a key protective factor of interest in suicide prevention. LET's CONNECT links adolescents who are identified as at risk for suicidal behavior with natural (e.g., parent, family member) and community mentors. The Senior Connection seeks to link sociallydisconnected seniors with a volunteer peer companion. In FY 2017, outcomes of randomized controlled trials will inform the practice of suicide prevention within these two particularly vulnerable populations. Mental Health Initiative Despite our recent significant gains, less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health problems receive the treatment they need.

Americans under the age of 45 years are more likely to die from violence and injuries than from any other cause. However, not all injuries have <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> prevention solutions. CDC's Injury Control Research Centers (ICRCs) are on the front line advancing violence and injury prevention science through cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research on the causes, outcomes, and prevention of violence and injuries. ICRCs research and evaluate cutting edgeways to improve injury prevention practices and determine the health and economic impacts of injury and violence prevention efforts to fill gaps in the evidence base. ICRCs conduct research on priority injury topics, including prescription drug overdose, traumatic brain injury, motor vehicle injuries, sexual violence, child abuse and neglect, and youth sports concussion. The academic institutions that comprise the ICRCs provide a high caliber of scientific competency, regional and national leadership in the field, and training for future injury researchers and the broader public health community. To develop and share interventions, ICRCs collaborate with state and local health agencies (including Core VIPP grantees), community partners, and other non-governmental organizations. Decision makers across the United States rely on ICRC research to shape federal, state, and local programs and policies.

CDC funds WHO and UNICEF to carry out essential country-support functions for vaccine-preventable diseases including direct technical oversight of these activities by assigning personnel to partner offices to fill critical strategic needs in support of regional vaccine-preventable disease elimination and control goals. Through mentorship and training, these personnel strengthen capacity of regional partners and ministries of health to transition to country ownership of programs. In FY 2017, CDC will continue integrating interventions with immunization activities. CDC also will work with countries to support appropriate use of vaccines in outbreak settings, remove systemic barriers to increase vaccine coverage, and use risk assessment tools to predict and manage outbreak risk. Ensuring High Vaccination Coverage As a partner of the Measles & Rubella Initiative, CDC remains committed--along with WHO, UNICEF, American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation--to reducing the global disease burden of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome. Achieving the goal of reducing global measles-related deaths from 114,900 in CY 2014 to 37,100 in CY 2016 will require a rapid expansion of high levels of population immunity. The WHO Region of the Americas reached another milestone with the elimination of endemic transmission of rubella, building on the feat of elimination of all native strains of measles transmission in 2000. CDC's research activities to drive continuous innovation, as seen in the polio eradication program, will be essential to reaching this challenging goal. In FY 2017, CDC will support this goal by ensuring high vaccination coverage with two doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccines. As part of this work, CDC will guide planning for the introduction of a second dose of measles- and rubella-containing vaccines in countries working toward this goal. CDC will also monitor disease trends using laboratory-based surveillance and will evaluate programmatic efforts to develop and maintain plans for outbreaks and case management. CDC will build public support for these vaccines through demand generation and will conduct research needed to support cost-effective and improved vaccination and diagnostic tools. Global Immunization Cooperative Agreements CDC's global immunization cooperative agreements enable UN agencies to direct polio eradication efforts, reduce measles and rubella mortality, and strengthen immunization systems overall. The FY 2015 partners were WHO, UNICEF, UN Foundation, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET), and Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET). In FY 2017, CDC will focus on providing key scientific analysis and laboratory support while funding seven awards through cooperative agreements for the current partners, assuming their continued ability to plan and execute program objectives in high-risk countries where polio, measles, and other high impact vaccine-preventable diseases remain endemic or a threat. CDC expects to increase the number of cooperative agreements between FY 2016 and FY 2017 to provide greater focus on developing best practices for the transition of country polio assets to broader public health use.

To support development of independent and sustainable national public health organizations, CDC makes catalytic investments and provides technical assistance to countries through the National Public Health Institutes (NPHI) Program. The program emphasizes high impact, transformative investments to address disease threats, health mandates, policy development, and public health research for a country. NPHIs are the "CDC" equivalent in other countries. They carry out essential public health functions while also improving accountability and efficiency.

CDC aggressively combats HAIs in all healthcare settings where patients receive clinical care. CDC's <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> guidelines are the standard of care for HAI prevention and are used by researchers, clinicians, federal partners, state and local health departments, and private sector partners to prevent HAIs and target healthcare facilities that need additional assistance. HAIs, such as CLABSI, CAUTI, SSI, and invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, are largely preventable with adherence to CDC guidelines. While dramatic reductions in CLABSI, MRSA, and select SSIs488 have been demonstrated, more work is needed to focus CAUTI and CDI prevention efforts. CDC data is used to target facilities that need enhanced implementation of CDC's <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> prevention practices, and to leverage state and federal partner resources to advance prevention progress. Reducing HAIs across healthcare settings supports national progress toward the HHS National Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare Associated Infections: Roadmap to Elimination (National HAI Action Plan)489 and the HHS Agency Priority Goal. Between CY 2008 and CY 2014, CLABSIs decreased 50% to a 0.50 Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) nationally in U.S. hospitals (Measure 3.3.3). While the overall SIR falls short of the 2014 target, CDC continues to move forward to meet the goals in the National HAI Action Plan. CLABSI reporting from hospital wards and other non-ICU locations is still growing, (e.g., CMS inpatient prospective payment system is requiring CLABSI reporting for wards as of January 2015), and existing prevention efforts are being refined for use outside of ICUs. CDC is further working to prevent CLABSI in all locations by using HAI data to identify specific hospitals and locations that can benefit from enhanced infection control practices and expertise. CDC replaced Measure 3.3.2a with a more nationally representative measure in FY 2015. This new measure is an estimate of the overall number of healthcare-associated MRSA bacteremia cases (healthcare onset and healthcare-associated community onset), the most common type of invasive MRSA infections in the U.S. Measures for both CLABSI and MRSA are included in the National HAI Action Plan; however, the measures of the current Action Plan were only set through December 2013. The results of national efforts to achieve these targets became available in fall of 2014. HHS proposed new HAI targets through December 2020 using data from January 2015 as the baseline. Targets established for CLABSI and MRSA for FY 2016 and beyond will align with those proposed in the new Action Plan.

Implementation of the ACA will continue to afford greater access to coverage for cancer screening services, and has potentially reduced the size of the NBCCEDP-eligible populations in 2016 and 2017. However, In FY 2017, CDC will continue to provide highquality direct screening to eligible women while increasing efforts to promote population-level screening for all appropriate women. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women in the United States. CRC screening can detect cancer early when treatment is more effective and colonoscopy can actually prevent cancer by removing precancerous polyps before they turn into cancer. In FY 2014, only 65.7% of adults aged 50-75 were screened for CRC.While a slight increase over FY 2012 results of 65.1,% screening rates have effectively plateaued in recent years (Measure 4.9.2). In response, CDC along with other key partners is a vital member of the National Colorectal Cancer Round Table's "80 by 2018" initiative. This partnership seeks to eliminate colorectal cancer as a major public health problem and is working toward the shared goal of reaching 80% screened for colorectal cancer by 2018. In addition, in 2015 CDC began funding a new cooperative agreement with 31 grantees (24 State Health Departments, six Universities and one tribe) to work with health systems partners to use a combination of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies to increase the number of people screened for CRC. These <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies include patient and provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback as recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services. Grantees will implement these strategies with the goal of increasing CRC screening rates within the health systems with which they partner. Cancer reporting from providers to State Cancer Registries is included in CMS Stage 2 Meaningful Use criteria. Electronic reporting from physician Electronic Health Records to cancer registries is one of six options to achieve Meaningful Use criteria and receive CMS payment incentives. Enhanced use of Electronic Health Records by state registries will improve the timeliness, completeness and quality of cancer data reported, particularly from non-hospital facilities. Enhanced data will improve cancer surveillance, encourage development of comprehensive cancer control programs, and plan health care interventions designed to reduce cancer incidence or improve early detection. Implementation of Meaningful Use will significantly increase the number of reports received for each case by the central registry. In FY 2015, 16 registries (35% of all registries) electronically received physician cancer reports from Electronic Health Record (EHR)/Electronic Medical Record (EMR), up from 13 registries (28%) in FY 2014 and exceeding the target for the second straight year. Physician incentives for meeting Meaningful Use criteria will facilitate the National Program of Cancer Registries meeting these targets (Measure 4.9.4).

The most recent ASD prevalence data (released in 2014) from ADDM estimated that 1 in 68 children living in ADDM Network communities during 2010 have ASD, a 30% increase since 2008. In part, this increase is due to improved identification, diagnosis, and treatment of children in local communities. ADDM has traditionally focused on 8-year-old children but has begun tracking 4-year-old children at some sites. Tracking 4-year-olds can help CDC understand more about children with ASD who are identified at a younger age, including when they are being evaluated and diagnosed. Knowing this will inform efforts to connect all children with autism to the services they need as soon as possible. Increasingly, the body of scientific evidence shows early treatment will improve the long-term outcome for children with ASD. CDC plays a critical role in the public health response to ASD by monitoring prevalence and characteristics in the population, investigating risk factors, and promoting early identification and tools to aid in developmental monitoring to healthcare professionals, early childhood educators, and parents of young children. Early monitoring, screening, and diagnosis improve access to services during a child's most critical developmental period. CDC's data from the ADDM Network are used to track outcomes closely related to early screening and diagnosis. Results from the 2010 study year show a slight decrease (0.5 percentage points) in the proportion of children with ASD who receive a first evaluation by 36 months of age (CI 5.1.5a). The results for study year 2010 indicate the proportion of children of minority race/ethnicity with ASD who receive a first evaluation by 36 months of age remain unchanged since 2008 (CI 5.1.5c). Additionally, results for the 2010 study year show a 2.4 percentage point decrease in the proportion of children with low socioeconomic status (CI 5.1.5b) and a 0.6 percentage point increase among children with low socioeconomic status of minority race/ethnicity (5.1.5d) who receive a first evaluation by 36 months. Both contextual indicators exceeded their respective 2010 targets of 33.9% and 37.1%. CDC also works to increase the percentage of primary care providers who (a) screen women of reproductive age for risky alcohol use and (b) provide appropriate, <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> interventions to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancy for those at risk (Measure 5.1.8). Increasing primary care provider screening for alcohol misuse among women of reproductive age and the provision of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> interventions are essential to improving maternal and child health and preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs).

ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, diagnosed in 11% of children aged 4-17 years. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends behavioral therapy as the first-line treatment for children ages 4-5 years, data suggest that only about half of the children aged 4-5 years with an ADHD diagnosis are receiving psychological services (a classification that includes behavioral therapy, but also other psychological services that are not <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a>).

CDC replaced Measure 8.A.E.1 with a new measure on timeliness of mortality and natality data (Measure 8.A.E.2). In FY 2014, CDC exceeded the target by releasing the mortality and natality data one month earlier at 10 months. Since 2011, timeliness of the release of mortality and natality data reported by the National Vital Statistics System has improved with each data year. These data provide crucial information for <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> decisions and planning and evaluation of public health and health programs and policies. The faster these data are available, the faster resources can be allocated and programs and policies can be evaluated and targeted. Faster access to these data also facilitates timely research related to births and deaths. CDC expects vital statistics timeliness to continue to improve as more states effectively use electronic systems that allow for faster reporting of data to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

CDC's research informs the development of new tools to manage and mitigate threats from drug and insecticide resistance, guides future program and policy decisions, and builds the capacity of host country governments through strategic partnerships. Based on evidence from CDC research over the last two decades, global malaria prevention and control programs continue to promote cost-effective interventions and scale-up efforts. These interventions include (1) intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), (2) insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) to protect individuals and communities from infected mosquitoes, and (3) artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) to treat individuals diagnosed with malaria. While CDC and its partners did not meet the FY 2014 President's Malaria Initiative535 (PMI) performance target for Measure 10.C.1, results modestly improved and continued to narrow the gap to the target. PMI countries scaled up the use of malaria prevention and treatment tools overall, expanding PMI to an additional four countries in 2007 and another eight countries in 2008, and fully expanding to the current 19 countries and the Greater Mekong Sub region as of 2012. Compared to the FY 2008 baseline, the percentage of children under five years old who slept under an insecticide-treated bed net the night before increased from 13% to 46% (Measure 10.C.1). While no countries have achieved the 85% goal, several countries are closing the gap and we anticipate this trend will continue the longer countries have been a part of PMI and achieved full scale up of interventions.536

Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness (-$8.2 million) The FY 2017 budget request reflects the elimination of the Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness. CDC will continue to support research and training for public health preparedness through the public health preparedness and response research agenda. Eliminating funding for these centers allows CDC to prioritize funding for state and local health departments through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (-$5.4 million) The FY 2017 budget request reflects the elimination for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

In FY 2016, CDC funded the Epilepsy Foundation, which works with 44 state and local chapters and several research cooperative agreements, including the Managing Epilepsy Well Network, which is currently comprised of eight Prevention Research Centers. Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding (-$8.0 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding program. This program was created in FY 2012 and has been funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This program promotes and supports <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies in states, communities, and hospitals to help women who choose to breastfeed to start and continue breastfeeding. State, local, or tribal recipients of the America's Health Block Grant could continue to promote breastfeeding as a way to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. National Lupus Patient Registry (-$6.0 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the National Lupus Patient Registry. This program supports lupus registries and related studies, raises awareness, educates patients and healthcare providers, and promotes interventions. In FY 2016, CDC funded follow-up studies focused on natural history, disparities, and healthcare access and treatment in three lupus registries. Elimination of this program is a part of the transition of CDC's chronic disease prevention portfolio to focus on the leading causes of death and disability. Million Hearts (-$4.0 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the Million Hearts program, which has previously been funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This program is a collaboration between CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to enhance cardiovascular disease prevention activities across the public and private sector. In FY 2016, CDC funded three partner organizations--including the National Association of Community Health Centers and the YMCA of USA. CDC remains committed to maximizing its efficiency and public health impact. CDC will continue to enhance cardiovascular disease prevention through existing resources. National Early Child Care Collaboratives (-$4.0 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the National Early Child Care Collaboratives program, which has previously been funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. State, local, or tribal recipients of the America's Health Block Grant could continue to promote similar prevention activities in the Early Child Care and Education (ECE) setting as a way to prevent obesity. This program implements obesity prevention initiatives targeting ECE settings to help establish and improve the healthy nutrition and physical activity habits of young children. To carry out this work, CDC supports ECE learning collaboratives in nine states to facilitate best practices in nutrition, breastfeeding support, physical activity, and screen time. Health Promotion (-$10.5 million) The Budget eliminates funding for activities funded under Health Promotion. This elimination also supports the transition of CDC's chronic disease prevention portfolio to focus on the priority areas funded by the Other Chronic Disease program line.

At this funding level, there is no dedicated funding for Colorectal, Prostate, and Skin Cancer. Through the expanded Comprehensive Cancer program, CDC will support activities to more effectively address the overall risk factors associated with specific types of cancers. Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (-$50.950 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) program. The FY 2018 Budget integrates existing disease-based activities into a new Block Grant to increase flexibility to States and Tribes to more efficiently and effectively address the leading causes of death and disability specific to each State. State, local, or tribal recipients of the $500 million America's Health Block Grant will continue work on the leading causes of death and disability in these communities. In FY 2016, CDC funded 49 governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, including state and local health departments, American Indian Tribes/Tribal Organizations, universities, and community-based organizations. Prevention Research Centers (-$25.413 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Prevention Research Center (PRC) program. This program works with academic institutions to conduct research and disseminate prevention interventions across United States. In FY 2016, CDC funded PRCs at 26 universities in 24 states to study how individuals and communities can avoid or counter the risks for chronic illnesses. For example, the PRCs funded Tulane University to research the strategy of creating bicycle lanes to increase physical activity in New Orleans. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also supports research on chronic diseases, including prevention research. CDC's chronic disease prevention portfolio will continue to focus on implementation of the most effective existing interventions. Epilepsy (-$8.000 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Epilepsy program. Elimination of this program supports the transition of CDC's chronic disease prevention portfolio to focus more narrowly on the leading causes of death and disability. The Epilepsy Program works with national organizations and researchers to develop and share public education programs and campaigns, and provide services for people with epilepsy. In FY 2016, CDC funded the Epilepsy Foundation, which works with 44 state and local chapters and several research cooperative agreements, including the Managing Epilepsy Well Network, which is currently comprised of eight Prevention Research Centers. Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding (-$8.000 million) The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding program. This program was created in FY 2012, funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This program promotes and supports <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> strategies in states, communities, and hospitals to help women who choose to breastfeed to start and continue breastfeeding.

CDC and HHS surveys use the NHIS as a benchmark for comparison of programs using state level data. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey27 is the only HHS survey combining household interviews with physical examinations and laboratory tests. The survey collects nationally representative data on the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions in the population. Conditions include diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. NHANES provided evidence of the rise in obesity in the United States for both adults and children, informing program planning and prevention efforts across HHS. CDC and other federal agencies, including NIH and USDA, rely heavily on NHANES to provide measurements for targeting resources and planning and evaluating programs. NHANES data have also been instrumental in providing a complete picture of opioid use among population subgroups--groups for whom we often do not have sufficient information for developing program or policy. National Health Care Surveys The National Health Care Surveys28 are a family of nationally representative provider-based surveys. The surveys cover a broad spectrum of health care settings to answer questions about the use of health care services and the delivery of care. Healthcare facilities, inpatient hospital units, and physician offices provide information on their practices, the delivery of services, and individual patient encounters. The National Hospital Care Survey29 (NHCS) obtains information on emergency department (ED) visits, including critical information on drug-related ED visits. Data Access and Analysis: To maximize efficiencies and improve the utility of the data, the Research Data Center (RDC) program has successfully participated with other HHS Operating Divisions to consolidate access to information while reducing burden to the government and data users. Additional partnerships have been established to expand access to health data, resulting in decreased costs and increased opportunities. Reduced funding would reduce the operations of the RDC for federal research and policy uses. Strengthening the Use of Evidence and Evaluation: The principal statistical agencies have a long history of sharing research findings and products with other agencies, and within HHS. Data from the official health statistics agency has become the linchpin for models of access to care. Data includes estimating the impact of changes in national policy on various segments of the U.S. population. Measurement and data collection provide information and evidence needed for making sound health policy. This information enhances monitoring the performance of programs that expend taxpayer dollars.

The healthcare system provides access to asthma healthcare providers and medication. In FY 2018 CDC will continue to offer education and expertise, quantify risks and vulnerabilities to asthma control, and fund state health departments to implement comprehensive asthma control programs. In FY 2018, CDC will prioritize proven prevention and control efforts that reduce the number of asthma hospitalization and emergency department visits among children. Comprehensive Asthma Control Programs No single intervention can, by itself, achieve asthma control on a population level. CDC implements a tiered approach to asthma control by using interventions with the strongest evidence of effectiveness, delivered as a comprehensive package. For people with asthma, a comprehensive approach assures availability of and access to guidelines-based medical management and appropriate medication use. For people whose asthma remains poorly controlled, additional steps provide progressively more individualized services, such as self-management education and home- and school-based trigger reduction. CDC funds 25 state health departments. These programs focus efforts on geographic areas or communities with a high or disproportionate burden of asthma. CDC funds have helped states achieve success. For example, the New Mexico asthma program showed that when one of their hospitals implemented a self-management education program with a certified asthma educator, asthma-related emergency department visits reduced by 90% and asthma-related hospitalizations went down by 93% among participants. Also, the New York State Asthma Program uses community health worker visits as an opportunity to provide tips on asthma management and how to reduce asthma triggers. In Buffalo, the effort reduced asthma attacks and symptoms by 67% and increased daily asthma medication use from 83% to 100% among participants. CDC focuses its efforts on comprehensive asthma control programs at the state level. At this funding level, support to state health departments would be reduced. In FY 2018, CDC will prioritize proven prevention and control efforts that reduce the number of asthma hospitalization and emergency department visits among children. Collaborative efforts across states to develop best practices and to test, scale, and deploy innovative approaches that meet local needs will continue, but at a reduced scope and scale. Asthma Surveillance Asthma control efforts cannot succeed without effective asthma surveillance. State and local health departments rely on asthma surveillance to efficiently and effectively direct their efforts to reduce the burden of asthma. CDC provides state-specific adult and child asthma prevalence data and other important measures of asthma control through existing data systems in the agency, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance

In mining, CDC will develop and make available new technologies and recommended practices that will reduce injuries and fatalities from machinery and rock falls, as well as exposures to harmful mine dusts, airborne pollutants, heat, and noise. CDC will work with mining partners to develop innovative control technologies and prevention practices. CDC will also address emerging occupational safety and health issues that may require new approaches to prevention, such as nanotechnology. Employees within nanotechnology-related industries are potentially exposed to uniquely engineered materials with novel sizes, shapes, and physical and chemical properties. CDC will work with private sector partners to develop effective interventions to control worker exposure, with specific prevention recommendations for employers that will support responsible development of the technology, resulting in sustainable economic growth and job creation through increased investments in nanotechnology. CDC field scientists will provide individualized assessments of potential workplace hazards through Health Hazard Evaluations to determine if workers are being exposed to hazardous materials or harmful conditions and if these exposures are affecting employee health.

Globally, there are 37 million people living with HIV, with 2 million new infections each year. Investments in controlling the HIV epidemic now will reduce the number of new infections and total number of persons living with HIV, which will both save lives and also decrease future costs of the epidemic. CDC plays an essential role in the fight against HIV by ensuring that science and practice rapidly evolve to accomplish the most efficient, high impact public health results. As an implementer41 of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), CDC works to support strong, sustainable national HIV programs and public health systems that can effectively lead their countries' sustained response to the epidemic, as well as to other global health threats, ultimately protecting Americans at home. CDC uses its expertise in public health science, long-standing partnerships with ministries of health, community organizations and other global partners to establish country-driven programs and systems, with a focus on ensuring high-quality HIV monitoring and evaluation to drive <a href='#' class='text-danger'>evidence-based</a> decisions.

From 2005 to 2014, there was a 19% decrease in annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (~40,000 new diagnoses each year) due to numerous federal, state, local government and community response efforts (Contextual Indicator (CI) 2.1.1).67 Also, in FY 2014, only 23.1% of persons received a HIV diagnosis late in the course of infection. Though not meeting the FY 2014 target, this is an improvement over 2012 and 2013 results (Measure 2.1.8). Diagnosis of HIV is only the first step in reducing infection. Patients must be linked to, and retained in, medical care in order to achieve viral suppression (having very low levels of HIV (viral load) present in the body). Evidence shows that viral suppression is not only critical for people living with HIV to maintain their health, it also prevents transmission of HIV to others. Recognizing the benefits of early treatment, and linkage to HIV medical care for all persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection, CDC's linkage to care goal changed from within three months of diagnosis to within one month of diagnosis. CDC is working to meet the national HIV prevention goal of ensuring 85% of all persons with diagnosed HIV are linked to medical care within one month of diagnosis (Measure 2.2.1). Linkage was 70.2% in 2010 (baseline year) and improved to 74.5% in 2014, exceeding the FY 2014 target and an increase over FY 2013 results. CDC is working in collaboration with state and local health departments to better monitor the effects of HIV medical care through expanded reporting of CD4 and viral load test results. Test results are vital indicators of which patients are in care and virally suppressed, and those patients who have fallen out of care. In FY 2015, 42 states and D.C., required reporting of all CD4 and viral load values, exceeding the FY 2015 target, and an increase of one state from FY 2014, continuing a steady increase in states meeting reporting requirements (Measure 2.2.4). The AIDS rate decreased from 10.8 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 6.8 per 100,000 in 2015, decreasing 37% and nearly a 10% reduction from FY 2014 (Measure 2.2.6). Referrals to Partner Services increased for people with diagnosed HIV in publically-funded HIV testing sites from 85% in 2013 to 90.7% in 2014, exceeding the 2014 target (Measure 2.2.2). Additionally, while referrals for these individuals to other HIV prevention services held steady at 78.8% in 2013 and 78.9% in 2014, the 2014 target (67%) was exceeded (Measure 2.2.3). Since FY 2011, referrals to Partner Services have increased eight percentage points while referrals to other HIV prevention services have increased 15 percentage points. CDC prioritized these services in its health department funding agreement, which began in FY 2012, and is providing expert advice and assistance to grantees to further improve performance in these areas. Scientific reviews demonstrate that school health programs can positively impact health-risk behaviors, health outcomes, and educational outcomes. CDC-led studies show that school health programs can be cost effective. For example, every dollar invested in school-based HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and pregnancy prevention efforts saves $2.65 in medical costs and social costs (including earnings-related outcomes, public assistance, and other outcomes).68 The percentage of students who have ever had sexual intercourse decreased significantly from 54.1% in 1991 to 41.2% in 2015. The percentage of adolescents in grades 9 to 12 abstaining

The birth rate for teenagers aged 15-19 has decreased over 50% in the past decade. This rate dropped from 24.2 per 1,000 in 2014 to 22.3 per 1,000 in 2015, reaching yet another record low for the U.S. (Measure 4.8.5). The availability of data through the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) allows CDC and states to monitor changes in maternal and child health status and indicators, identify groups of women and infants at high risk for health problems, and measure progress toward goals in improving the health of mothers and infants. CDC realigned the core set of questions, used in PRAMS, to include measures of safe sleep practices in order to evaluate community-based infant death prevention recommendations for reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. In FY 2016 40 sites collected data to assess safe sleep practices using the PRAMS safe sleep module, nearly three times the number of sites in FY 2015 (Measure 4.8.4). CDC uses the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to track sexual behaviors and contraceptive use among women and men ages 15 to 44. The proportion of all women ages 15-44 years at risk of unintended pregnancy who report using long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) increased from 2.0% in FY 2002 to 11.9% in FY 2015, a 23% increase over FY 2013 and exceeding the FY 2015 target.

The Committee continues to strongly support the successful NDPP and directs all new funds provided in fiscal year 2016 and 2017 support an increase in the number of new competitively awarded program providers. Specifically, the focus should be on rural providers where the risk and burden of diabetes is greater, and where the program has the potential for the biggest impact. The Committee understands models exist for pairing the capacity of existing program providers with program delivery areas that lack sufficient resources to operate the program. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request on how these resources are being used for the provided purposes, how observable weight measure is being maintained, and how peer-reviewed science compares virtual providers to face to-face providers. The Committee requests CDC include long-term public health measures and how this program coordinates with other CDC and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs.

Obesity: The Committee continues support for the rural extension and outreach services program to support grants for rural counties with an obesity prevalence of over 40 percent. The Committee expects support for childhood obesity interventions based on scientific evidence to support measurable outcomes through evidenced- based obesity research, intervention, and prevention programs. The program should include a special focus on areas with the highest population-adjusted burden of obesity and with comorbidities like hypertension, cardiac disease and diabetes. The Committee understands the need to maximize impact of these funds, for this reason and to assure coordination with other activities, CDC should allocate maximum dollars to State programs.

Most States screen for the overwhelming majority of the disorders listed on the RUSP but it can take several years for States to add new conditions. The Committee requests CDC provide an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request on actions planned and on-going to work with States on ways to ensure screening of infants for diseases for which there is a preventable and/or effective treatment. Further, the update should note what steps can be taken to encourage States to adopt and implement new RUSP conditions within one year of their addition.

Vitamin D: The Committee is aware some epidemiological studies connect the lack of vitamin D to increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, breast cancer, and other diseases. In 2010, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that the recommended daily intakes of vitamin D supplements did not provide any health benefit other bone health. The Committee directs CDC to charter a National Academies of Sciences comprehensive study on the link between vitamin D and other health benefits of sun exposure; vitamin D supplements' efficacy compared to non-burning sunshine; and the issue of sunburns as the trigger for melanoma as opposed to non-burning sunshine.

High Obesity Rate Counties: The Committee remains concerned about the growing body of evidence suggesting that obesity is one of the most significant challenges facing the public health system. If this epidemic continues unabated, obesity and the many complications it causes will increase the disease burden among Americans, particularly youth. The Committee continues to include $10,000,000 to support the rural extension and outreach services grants for rural counties with an obesity prevalence of over 40 percent. The Committee expects CDC to work with State and local public health departments to support measurable outcomes through evidenced-based obesity research, intervention, and prevention programs. Grants should combine basic, clinical, and population research to better understand and treat the metabolic, medical, surgical, environmental, and societal implications of obesity in cooperation with partners that have existing outreach capacity to develop and implement educational and intervention programs. CDC should focus its efforts in areas of the country with the highest burden of obesity and with the comorbidities of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes from county level data in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The Committee encourages CDC to only support activities that are supported by scientific evidence.

Improving data quality, data timeliness, and tracking trends to monitor the epidemic. Accurate, detailed, and timely data (e.g., data related to prescribing, non-fatal and fatal opioidinvolved overdoses and associated risk factors, and the health effects of opioids) are critical to understanding burden, advancing prevention, and understanding the impact of interventions. 2. Strengthening state efforts by scaling up promising and effective public health interventions.
