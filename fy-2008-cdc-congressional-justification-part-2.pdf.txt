EFFECTS OF CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON PERFORMANCE TARGETS
Given the uncertainty of final FY 2007 appropriation levels at the time CDC developed the performance targets for the FY 2008 Congressional Justification, the FY 2007 targets were not modified to reflect differences between the President's Budget and the Continuing Resolution funding levels. Enacted funding may require modifications of the FY 2007 performance targets. Only one performance measure, located in the Environmental Health section, reflects an adjustment in its FY 2007 target due to the Continuing Resolution.

Cross Reference: HHS-8

Efficiency Measure 1:
The Vaccine Management Business Improvement Project (VMBIP) is a CDC initiative aimed at increasing the efficiency, visibility, and management of publicly purchased vaccines by centralizing and consolidating vaccine inventory and distribution. Currently, publicly purchased vaccine, including vaccine purchased by the Section 317 program, is held at various third party distribution depots or in state run depots. It is estimated that 400 storage locations exist. Even though the current system works, it is inefficient. The large number of depots results in redundancy of distribution resources, reduces the efficiency of distribution, and impedes the program's ability to track vaccine.
CDC, through VMBIP, contracted with McKesson Specialty Distribution in September 2006 to consolidate national inventory in significantly fewer inventory depots than currently exist and distribute vaccine through a streamlined central system. The expected efficiencies gained from consolidation of vaccine depots include improved management of vaccine inventory through use of distribution best practices and increased visibility of the location of vaccines throughout the public vaccine supply chain. As phased implementation progresses, the number of locations holding vaccines will decrease until full implementation is complete by FY 2009 and vaccine inventory depots are reduced by 98 percent. The first pilot sites which are Washington State, California, the City of Chicago, and Maryland will begin distributing through the centralized distribution system in February 2007.

Data Source: National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), National Congenital Rubella Syndrome Registry (NCRSR), Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs), Emerging Infections Programs.

Data Validation: NNDSS - CDC receives reports of notifiable diseases from the 50 state health departments, New York City, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. Territories. These reports are initiated when health care providers suspect or diagnose a case of
a notifiable disease. Clinical laboratories also report results consistent with reportable diseases. Reporting of nationally notifiable diseases to CDC by the states is voluntary and only mandated (i.e., by state legislation or regulation) at the state level. All case reports, especially for low incidence and internationally quarantinable diseases, must be verified by the appropriate state officials.
NNDSS case counts are likely incomplete, and therefore, these data are considered to represent a minimum number of cases. State reporting practices and some administrative procedures used in processing the NNDSS data may impact surveillance data reports and analyses. CDC staffs provide technical assistance relevant for data verification to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. Specifically, assistance includes: computer specifications and software for reporting from state and territorial health departments, development and implementation of procedures to validate surveillance data, and identification of incomplete records, transmission errors, and deviations from expected numbers. NCRSR - CDC maintains the NCRSR with supplemental information to NNDSS. The registry includes data only on cases classified as confirmed or compatible. Cases are also classified as indigenous (exposure within the United States) and imported (exposure outside the United States) and are tabulated by year of birth. In contrast, cases reported to the NNDSS are tabulated by year of report. ABCs is an active laboratory and population-based
surveillance system for invasive bacterial pathogens of public health importance, and currently operates in 10 sites in the U.S. For each case of invasive disease in the surveillance population, a case report with basic demographic information is completed and bacterial isolates are sent to CDC and other reference laboratories for additional laboratory evaluation. The ABCs program provides routine laboratory audits to ensure the completeness of data collection. Each month, CDC staff review data and communicate potential errors to state personnel for evaluation. Performance standards for active surveillance have been established in each site to permit aggregation of data collected via somewhat different approaches. Detailed instructions for completion of case report forms ensure consistency across sites. Timeliness and completeness of reporting in ABCs is evaluated using threshold percentages of
isolate collection and enrollment into special studies. Surveillance "fatigue" or operational problems are assessed using isolate shipping schedules, audit sensitivities, and the timeliness of the audit data being completed by set deadlines.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES

Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) ­ Conjugate vaccines for the prevention of Hib are highly effective. Hib is no longer the leading cause of meningitis among children younger than five years old in the U.S. The number of possible cases reported increased from 196 cases in 2004 to 226 cases in 2005, and the FY 2005 target of 150 cases remains unmet. In accordance with the Healthy People 2010 goal, this measure includes both type b cases (for which vaccine would be effective) and those with unknown serotypes. The number of cases with unknown serotypes that are actually type b cannot be confirmed. Neither Healthy People 2010 targets nor GPRA targets have been adjusted to account for cases with unknown serotype. Therefore, while this goal remains unmet, the actual number of type b cases (both serotyped and not) for which the vaccine would have been effective may have remained the same or even decreased; the increase in cases from 2004 to 2005 may be explained by these disease reporting challenges. To address this issue of incomplete serotyping, CDC is working with state partners to provide technical assistance for enhanced Hib surveillance and laboratory support.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:

Provisional data indicate that the mumps disease targets will not be met in 2005 or 2006 due to a large national mumps outbreak that began in December 2005 and continued through 2006. Although the highest number of cases was reported from states in the Midwest, most states reported increases in number of mumps cases. The majority of cases occurred among persons 18-25 years of age, many of these persons were vaccinated with two doses, reflecting the 90%-95% effectiveness of this vaccination schedule. As a result of this outbreak, vaccination recommendations were modified to better define evidence of immunity, ensure routine vaccination for health care workers, and address additional vaccination needs for persons in outbreak settings. Prior to 2004, there had been some progress in mumps disease reduction ­ reflected by a two-thirds reduction in cases from 1998 (666 cases) to 2003 (231 cases). However, the number of mumps cases in 2004 increased to 258 and CDC did not meet the 2004 goal of 200 cases.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 3:

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial illness characterized by prolonged and severe cough and sometimes pneumonia. Although pertussis affects all age groups, complications and death are most frequently recognized among unvaccinated infants. The 2005 target was to reduce the number of pertussis cases among children under seven years of age to 2,300. The actual number of cases in this age group was 7,347. Most of these cases occurred among children who are not fully protected from disease. Children are not fully protected until they receive four doses of the vaccine by 15-18 months. Many cases occur among infants who are exposed to disease before they receive their first vaccination at two months of age. Introduction in 2005 of adolescent and adult versions of improved acellular pertussis vaccines with tetanus and diphtheria booster (DTap vaccine) provides new opportunities for reducing severe pertussis and its complications in all age groups in the U.S.

GOAL 2: ENSURE THAT 2-YEAR-OLDS ARE APPROPRIATELY VACCINATED.

Data Source: Data are collected through the National Immunization Survey (NIS) and reflect calendar years.

Data Validation: The NIS uses a nationally representative sample and provides estimates of vaccination coverage rates that are
weighted to represent the entire population, nationally, and by region, state, and selected large metropolitan areas. The NIS, a telephone-based survey, is administered by random-digit-dialing to find households with children aged 19 to 35 months. Parents or guardians are asked about the vaccines­with dates­that appear on the child's "shot card" kept in the home; demographic and socioeconomic information is also collected. At the end of the interview with parents or guardians, survey administrators request permission to contact the child's vaccination providers. Providers are then contacted by mail to provide a record of all
immunizations given to the child. Examples of quality control procedures include 100% verification of all entered data with a sub sample of records independently entered. The quarterly data files are reviewed for consistency and completeness by CDC's National Immunization Program, Immunization Services Division - Assessment Branch and CDC's National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) Office of Research and Methodology. NCHS also conducts a separate qualitative assessment of 10% of the records. Random monitoring by supervisors of interviewers' questionnaire administration styles and data entry accuracy occurs daily. Annual methodology reports are available to the public for review.

Cross Reference: HHS-1, HP-14.24a, PART, PAR, 500-1

1 Due to a shortage in vaccine and temporary change in recommendations, 3 doses were reported from 2002 ­ 2003.
 2 Includes any measles-containing vaccine.
 3 Performance targets for any newly recommended vaccines, such as pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, are reported in 
 GPRA five years after an ACIP recommendation is made and once NIS data become available. The timing of data availability may also be 
 impacted by the age group for which that particular vaccine is recommended.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:

The ACIP Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule recommends routine vaccination of children for the above diseases. The target of 90 percent coverage was met in 2005 for most vaccines with the exception of varicella and the fourth dose of DTaP.
In 2005, the coverage rate for four doses of DTaP containing vaccine did not yet achieve the 90 percent goal. However, the coverage rate for the fourth dose has steadily increased since the change to a four dose schedule, as recommended by the ACIP in 1991. The ACIP also recommends that a fifth dose be given to children between four and six years of age for full vaccination. This goal continues to be difficult to achieve because it requires that the fourth dose be given to the child between 15 and 18 months of age. The administration of DTaP tends to coincide with regular well-baby visits through the third dose; however, the fourth dose does not, requiring a visit specifically for this purpose. Coverage rates are 96 percent for the first three DTaP doses. Although the first three doses are considered to be most critical, CDC and the ACIP feel strongly that the fourth dose and also the fifth dose are important for full vaccination. Varying state requirements for the four-dose vaccine schedule may have also led to a slower increase in coverage. In 2002 and 2003, CDC modified reporting on DTaP from four doses to three doses because vaccine shortages limited the availability of the fourth dose. This change was made because the ACIP recommends that if this vaccine is in short supply, or not available, the fourth dose of DTaP may be dropped. The performance reporting change was temporary and reporting for the fourth dose has now been implemented.
Varicella is the most recently introduced vaccine that has a measurable target. Varicella vaccination rates are rising with coverage at only 43 percent in 1998 and reaching 88 percent in 2005. CDC is close to meeting the 90 percent varicella vaccines coverage goal, and is continuing to increase coverage. CDC/HHS and the ACIP recently made policy changes for the use of varicella (chickenpox) vaccine to include a recommendation for routine two-dose varicella vaccination of children. This new recommendation is expected to further reduce the number of cases and outbreaks of varicella in the United States.
The prevention of pneumococcal infections with PCV is becoming more important because of problems with treatment due to antibiotic resistance. The ACIP added PCV to the 2001 Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule. Accountability for performance targets will begin with CY 2006 data which will not be available until the next budget cycle. The vaccination coverage level for PCV in 2005 is 83 percent for three doses.

Data Source: National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

Data Validation: NHIS is a cross-sectional household interview survey. Households chosen for interviews are a probability sample representative of the target population. The annual response rate is more than 90 percent of eligible households in the sample. NHIS has three modules: 1) The basic module remains largely unchanged from year to year and allows for trend analysis. Data
from more than one year can also be pooled to increase the sample size for analytic purposes. The basic module contains a family core, a sample adult core, and a child core through which data are collected on the family unit and from one randomly selected adult and child. 2) Periodic modules collect more detailed information on some of the topics included in the basic module. 3) Topical modules respond to new data needs as they arise. Data are collected through a personal household interview conducted by staff employed and trained by the U.S. Bureau of the Census according to procedures delineated by CDC. Data are reviewed and analyzed extensively to ensure their validity and reliability. The survey sample is designed to yield estimates that are representative and that have acceptably small variations. Before the actual survey, cognitive testing is performed by CDC's Questionnaire Design
Research laboratory, and pretests are conducted in the field. Once collected, data are carefully edited, checked, and compared to data from earlier surveys and/or independent sources. Staff members calculate descriptive statistics and perform in-depth analyses, which result in feedback on the analytic usefulness of the data.

Goal 3, Performance Measure 1:
During the past decade, vaccination coverage levels among older adults increased steadily as CDC implemented national strategies and promoted adult and adolescent immunization among healthcare providers and state and local governments. Influenza vaccination coverage levels among the elderly have increased from 30 percent in 1989 to 65 percent in 2004. However, data suggest that influenza vaccination levels may have reached a plateau, and in 2005 a decrease to coverage of 60 percent was observed. This is most likely related to unprecedented shortages of influenza vaccination in the 2004-2005 season and delays of influenza vaccinations in the 2005-2006 seasons.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES
Despite recent vaccine availability issues, the increase in vaccination coverage began to slow before 2000. The plateau is not fully understood. Because large gaps remain between existing coverage levels and some of the targets for subsequent years, CDC has decided to maintain an influenza vaccination target of 74 percent for 2005, 2006 and 2007. There was an increase in vaccine supply to over 100 million doses in the 2006-2007 influenza season, and it is anticipated that supply will continue to increase in upcoming years. CDC and partners such as the National Influenza Vaccine Summit will continue to aggressively promote vaccination. Additionally, the FY 2007 and FY 2008 President's Budgets request funds to increase demand for influenza vaccine. Therefore, CDC has increased the target in 2008 to 85 percent coverage for influenza vaccination.
An increasing proportion of older adults also reported receipt of pneumococcal vaccination, from 15 percent in 1989 to 57 percent in 2004. Although the proportion of older adults receiving pneumococcal vaccine in 2005 (56.2%) remained consistent with the 2004 result, in neither year was the goal of 69% met. Adult vaccination rates are slowly increasing, and CDC has worked with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services to raise the reimbursement rate for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Similar challenges apply to pneumococcal vaccination in adults as influenza vaccination. Because large gaps remain between existing coverage levels and some of the targets for subsequent years, CDC has decided to maintain the same targets for 2005, 2006 and 2007 for pneumococcal vaccination in this age group. However, due to an anticipated increase in aggressive vaccine promotion efforts, especially focused on influenza vaccination, but also including messages about pneumococcal vaccination, CDC has raised the 2008 goal to 80 percent.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 2:
The ACIP Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule recommends vaccination for influenza for adults at high risk of complications each year and pneumococcal vaccination for those persons at high risk. Current levels of coverage among adults vary widely among different age, risk, and racial and ethnic groups. Highrisk adults aged 18 to 64 years may not have insurance coverage for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, may make fewer visits for preventive care, and may not recognize they are recommended to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Persons with high-risk conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, remain at increased risk from these diseases. For this population of high risk adults 18 to 64 years of age, the pneumococcal vaccination goal of 22% has been met. However, as was noted for adults 65 years of age and older, a decrease in influenza vaccine coverage was seen in 2005 for the 18 to 64 year old population. It is likely that issues with vaccine availability, distribution, and recognition of priority group recommendation affected coverage status.

isolates for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Given that global coverage is necessary for both routine influenza virus monitoring and development of capacity to identify avian influenza for containment and response, ability to test of avian and other influenza and submit timely specimens is critical. Increasing geographic participation and enhancing capacity in more countries greatly increases the
probability of detecting a case or cluster of H5N1.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
This measure tracks CDC's efforts to increase the number of influenza networks globally to enhance early detection of viruses with pandemic potential and improve vaccine decision-making. Early detection of pandemic viruses will benefit the international community by allowing the maximum lead time possible to develop pandemic vaccines, thus reducing morbidity and mortality globally. The accomplishment of this measure will also establish the influenza surveillance foundation necessary to conduct influenza burden studies, formulate vaccine policy, and reduce illness due to influenza through vaccination. Ideally, a network will be a nationwide system developed to collect virologic and epidemiologic data for influenza by establishing five or more sites with good distribution throughout the country. Each site will consist of a local laboratory and one or more clinics or hospitals for data collection. However, some flexibility of this definition may be needed based on geographic and resource considerations.
Currently, CDC supports 13 influenza surveillance networks globally through cooperative agreements. Support is provided through on-site training, the provision of technical assistance, and funding for equipment and supplies. As part of the overall plan to develop networks in Asia, key staff have been located in Asia with CDC assignments to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the Western Pacific Office of WHO. CDC provides technical assistance and support for enhancing or developing influenza surveillance networks. In addition, CDC provides support and assistance to foreign governments for the establishment of surveillance networks in Cambodia, Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Philippines, Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, China Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (a consortium of seven countries and territories including Cook Islands, Fiji, Guam, Wallis and Futuna, Palau and Tonga). Finally, CDC provided critical support to partners in Department of Defense (DOD) at both Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)-2 in Jakarta and NAMRU3 in Cairo. The collaborations enhance technical assistance regionally and improve sharing of international specimens. Expansion of the bilateral cooperative agreements in FY 2007 is planned with a focus on countries outside of Asia affected by avian influenza.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES

Incidence of pneumococcal disease fell between 2001 and 2005. These data indicate that CDC is on track to reach disease reduction targets. Progress is aided by the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that was licensed for use in children in the U.S. in 2000. Vaccinating children has reduced disease in adults through reduced transmission. However, some challenges remain. Supplies of the conjugate vaccine were inadequate between 2001 and 2004. CDC has worked with the vaccine manufacturer, ACIP, and professional organizations to promote optimal and equitable use of vaccine during times of shortage. Vaccine supply is now adequate. However, a small increase in disease caused by strains not covered by the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been detected, and CDC is monitoring trends in these strains.

Goal 6, Performance Measure 1:
The VSD is a collaborative effort involving CDC and several large managed care organizations (MCOs). The VSD was established primarily to assess immunization safety issues in the U.S. by conducting scientific studies utilizing a large-linked database (LLD) that incorporates administrative data sources at each MCO and also utilizing additional site resources such as medical charts. Each participating site gathers information regarding the vaccination and medical records of millions of children and adults. Collectively, the data from VSD studies are derived from participating MCOs that contain more than nine million members, of which the VSD project collects comprehensive medical information for more than 5.5 million people annually. The VSD enables population-based immunization and safety research studies to compare the incidence of health problems between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The performance target for this goal was not met in FY 2005 because increasing populations in LLDs is contingent on cooperating entities, resources, and technologies. This performance measure reflects only one aspect of CDC's immunization safety surveillance; CDC's immunization safety activities are not limited to this one project.

Data Validation: CDC conducts validation and evaluation studies of data systems which track AIDS deaths and HIV diagnosis to determine the quality of data generated by them.
Cross Reference: HHS-8

Efficiency Measure 1:
In FY 2004, CDC consolidated six program announcements for CBOs into one program announcement. The consolidation decreased the administrative work at CDC required to develop, publish, compete, review and award six different program announcements. This consolidation also provided CDC with the opportunity to improve oversight of grantees by reducing the number of different grant requirements which project officers are expected to know. Finally, the new program announcement included a set of core performance indicators to monitor and evaluate grantee performance.
The review process used to evaluate applications involves convening special emphasis panels, obtaining subject matter experts, conducting pre-decisional site visits and budget negotiations, and developing technical reports for each program announcement. By consolidating the six program announcements, CDC was able to streamline the review and oversight process, thereby decreasing staff time and cost for all of these functions.
This efficiency measure was a temporary measure that was used to demonstrate the efficiency of CDC staff in developing, publishing, and completing the review and award of funds for one comprehensive program announcement for directly funded CBOs compared with six different announcements. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Efficiency Measure 2:
As available treatments prolong the lives of those infected with HIV and slow the progression to AIDS, AIDS data are increasingly insufficient to describe the national epidemic. Accurate, reliable, and comparable HIV data are needed from all states to describe the epidemic nationally. Although all states have implemented HIV reporting, it occurs via a number of methods. As of December 2006, 46 states and five territories and Washington, D.C. have adopted confidential, name-based reporting and four states implement code-based systems. Except for HIV, all other reported infectious diseases, including AIDS, are routinely reported to states using name-based reporting systems. Personal identifiers are removed from this data prior to submission to CDC. Because of the lack of standard methods for reporting diagnoses and the potential for duplication of cases arising from these multiple methods, HIV

FY 2008 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION
 SAFERHEALTHIERPEOPLETM

240

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STD, AND TB PREVENTION
data are not sufficiently accurate and reliable to provide data on HIV prevalence nationwide. CDC's policy is to accept HIV infection and AIDS case surveillance data only from areas conducting confidential name-based reporting because this reporting has been shown to routinely achieve high levels of accuracy and reliability. Further, only confidential name-based HIV reporting integrated with AIDS surveillance data can be used by states to remove duplicate cases reported to CDC's national surveillance database. For these reasons, in July 2005, CDC recommended that states conduct HIV reporting using the same name-based approach currently used for AIDS surveillance nationwide. This measure will monitor changes from coded systems to confidential, name-based reporting. Such changes will increase the proportion of HIV cases that are included in the national database, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the epidemic nationwide and enabling better targeting of federal HIV resources.
Efficiency Measure 3:
CDC funds both non-research and research funding opportunity announcements for HIV (Domestic), STDs and TB. Unobligated funds (i.e. carryover) are common for grantees due to various circumstances such as: unspent personnel funds realized while grantees' are advertising jobs; unspent contractual funds when grantees publish program announcements for subcontractors; savings realized in purchases of equipment or services; and in-kind resources acquired by grantees from donations to cover approved expenses.
For FY 2005, HIV (Domestic), STD and TB programs carryover requests averaged 52 days for processing. In order to meet PGO's key performance indicator (KPI) target, CDC will improve the average time to process request to award by meeting PGO's KPI of 29 days for carryover requests as the end target.
This is an important efficiency for CDC for two reasons. First, the unobligated funds are reobligated to program, mission-direct grantee activities and are needed in a timely fashion. Second, this efficiency measure will decrease the amount of staff time spent on administrative activities.

OVERARCHING HIV/AIDS PREVENTION
Twenty-five years into the epidemic, HIV is still a fatal infection for which there is no cure. Available treatments have dramatically improved the lives of those infected. However, treatments must be taken over the course of a lifetime, have serious side-effects, and are costly. Further, one-quarter of those who are infected do not know of their infection and do not benefit from treatment. The chief goal of CDC's HIV efforts is to reduce the number of new infections in the U.S.

AGE, FROM 2,100 IN 2000 TO APPROXIMATELY 1,600 IN 2010.
Data Source: HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Data Validation: HIV data collection systems vary between areas (e.g., name-based code, coded identifier, name-to-code data collection systems). CDC recommends that all states and territories adopt confidential name-based HIV surveillance systems. As of December 2006, 46 states, the District of Columbia and five territories use confidential name-based HIV surveillance, while two states use name-to-code based systems, and five states and the District of Columbia use code-based methods. The 25 states with mature, stable HIV surveillance systems at baseline are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The 30 area comparison group includes the 25 states plus Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The period of time between a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS and the arrival of a case report at CDC is called the "reporting delay". The 33 states included in targets for rates include the 29 states listed above and Alaska, Kansas, New York, and Texas. Targets for 2008 have been converted to rates; previous targets were set based on the number of cases reported. Population data come from the Bureau of Census and are limited to the population of persons under 25 years of age in the 33 states. The period of time between a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS and the arrival of a case report at CDC is called the "reporting delay". In order to provide the best estimates of recent trends, HIV and AIDS surveillance data are analyzed by date of diagnosis and are statistically adjusted for reporting delays and incomplete information on some cases. CDC requires a minimum of 12 months after the end of a calendar year to provide accurate estimates of trends for that year. Cross Reference: Measure 1 ­ HHS-1, PART, PAR, 500-6; Measure 2 - HHS-1, HP-13.17, PAR, 500-6
1This measure was first reported in FY 2004 and therefore, targets begin in FY 2004. However, actual performance is shown for previous years because the data was available, even though it was not reported in the form of a measure.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:
The rate of HIV infection diagnoses among persons under 25 years of age each year is the best data available to monitor new HIV infections on an annual basis. HIV infections occurring in this group are likely to have been acquired recently and thus are a relatively good proxy measure of HIV incidence. In addition, it enables CDC to examine yearly trends in reported cases by risk, demographic, and geographic variables. The data are from a national surveillance system that collects demographic, clinical, and behavioral information on all AIDS cases diagnosed in the U.S., as well as HIV cases diagnosed in states with name-based HIV reporting requirements. Data for 2008 will be reported as rates from 33 states with long-standing HIV reporting. Rates provide a more accurate methodology of measuring program performance over time, as they provide a percentage for the population affected. Targets for previous years were set based on the number of cases reported. While annual data on HIV incidence are not yet available, CDC has estimated HIV incidence in the past. After dramatic reductions from a peak of 150,000 infections per year in the mid-1980's, annual HIV incidence is hypothesized to be level in the U.S. However, recent outbreaks of syphilis among men who have sex with men have raised concerns that HIV incidence may be rising rather than decreasing. CDC is working to reduce incidence in this and other high risk groups. Recent initiatives to greatly expand HIV testing are expected to have a substantial impact on the proportion of infected persons who are diagnosed. Therefore, in the short term, the number of cases diagnosed and reported to CDC is expected to rise. The FY 2007 and FY 2008 targets have been adjusted accordingly. In the long-term, helping people learn of their infection and providing them prevention services is expected to decrease the number of new infections.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
Surveillance data published through 2005 show sharply declining trends in perinatal AIDS cases since the mid-1990s. This decline was strongly associated with increasing zidovudine use in pregnant women who were aware of their HIV status. More recently, improved treatment likely delays the onset of AIDS for HIV-infected children. With efforts to maximally reduce perinatal HIV transmission and increase treatment for those infected, cases are likely to remain low.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
Because every new HIV infection is the result of transmission from an infected person, encouraging infected persons to adopt safe behaviors is one of the highest priorities of HIV prevention. Helping those who are infected to adopt safer behaviors is a key strategy of CDC's HIV initiative, Advancing HIV Prevention (AHP). In 2004, CDC asked state grantees to prioritize interventions with those who are HIV-infected, and included prevention with infected persons as a key component of their new directly-funded CBO program. Targets and actual performance estimates represent the median figure from 16 participating areas. The survey used until 2004 for this measure was discontinued that year. Beginning in 2007, data for this measure will be collected through the new Medical Monitoring Project (MMP), which is to collect data beginning in 2007.

Cross Reference: Measure 1 ­ HHS-1, HP-13.15, PART, 500-6; Measure 2 ­ HHS-1, 500-6

Goal 3:

As deaths due to AIDS have decreased and the rate of new infections has remained stable, the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS has increased. If incidence does not decrease, the number of persons living with HIV and AIDS is expected to continue to increase slightly each year. Further, of the estimated 1,039,000 to 1,185,000 persons infected with HIV in the U.S., one-fourth are unaware of their infection. Reducing the incidence of both new infections and HIV associated morbidity and mortality will require earlier testing and improved access to prevention and care services for persons with HIV. Research shows that persons who are aware of their infection are more likely to adopt behaviors to protect themselves and their partners. Thus, promoting knowledge of serostatus among those who are infected is essential in preventing new infections. In 2006, as part of the President's initiative to Continue the Fight Against HIV/AIDS in America, CDC issued revised recommendations for HIV testing for adults and adolescents, aimed at increasing the proportion of persons who are aware of their infection. The recommendations call for voluntary, routine testing of all adults and adolescents, without regard to expressed risk and simplify the consent process. CDC has begun to plan for other key parts of the initiative, including programs to directly provide testing to jurisdictions with the highest numbers of new cases.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 1:

This measure is an indicator of the percentage of persons who learn of their infection before the development of an AIDS-defining condition. Compared with early testers, late testers are more likely to be young, black or Hispanic and to receive HIV testing because of illness. Early testers are more likely to seek testing because of self-perceived risk. The percentage of persons diagnosed with HIV and AIDS simultaneously should decrease over time if a greater proportion of HIV-infected persons find out their HIV status earlier. Activities related to these measures include efforts to increase knowledge of HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing, and to encourage routine testing for HIV in health care settings.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 2:

Each year, approximately two million publicly funded HIV tests are reported from over 11,000 sites, each with varying
rates of clients returning for their test results. There was a reported increase from 69.3 percent in 2000 to 71 percent in 2004 in the percentage of HIV-positive test results from CDC-funded sites with post test counseling reported. CDC is working with all grantees to continue improving the return rates for HIV-positive test results. HIV rapid tests now allow return of preliminary HIV test results "while you wait" increasing the number of people who receive their preliminary results. HIV positive test results still require confirmatory testing, with results shared at post-test counseling sessions. In FY 2002, two jurisdictions reported incomplete data and were not included in the overall calculation.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
This measure reflects linkage to care after initial diagnosis. A physician should evaluate an HIV-infected person soon after receiving the initial positive results. However, many persons are not evaluated because of fear or lack of access to medical care. The data through 2004 for this measure were collected through interviews with HIV-infected persons in 16 areas. That survey has been discontinued. Beginning in 2007, data will be collected using the new MMP. While in transition to the MMP, the national survey was not conducted in 2005 or in 2006. Therefore, data will not be available for 2005 and 2006.

Goal 5, Performance Measure 1:
Historically, new AIDS cases (AIDS incidence) were the basis for assessing needs for prevention and treatment programs. However, potent new antiretroviral therapies are delaying the development of AIDS in many HIV-infected persons and AIDS data are no longer sufficient to describe the epidemic. Data on HIV are now needed. Currently, all states have implemented some form of HIV reporting. HIV reporting in the U.S. is conducted using one of three methods: 1) name-based; 2) code; and, 3) name-to-code. As of December 2006, 46 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories use confidential name-based reporting systems for HIV case surveillance. CDC recommends that all states use confidential name-based methods for HIV case surveillance and is working with states to implement and improve HIV reporting and is implementing methods to estimate HIV incidence nationally.
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
CDC supports STD prevention and control by: 1) monitoring disease trends using national and local data to focus and assess current prevention activities; 2) conducting behavioral, clinical, and health services research and program evaluation to provide a scientific base for improving program efforts; 3) providing education and training through guideline development, 10 regional STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers, and programs to ensure that health care

professionals are prepared to provide optimal STD treatment, care, and prevention services; and, 4) building national partnerships for STD prevention to educate health professionals, the public, and policymakers about the importance of STD prevention and the impact of STDs on the health of Americans, particularly women and infants, adolescents, and minority populations; and 5) providing financial, direct personnel, and technical assistance to state and local health departments to deliver clinical and prevention services.
Two foci are syphilis elimination and infertility prevention. CDC also supports special surveillance studies for human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2); supports epidemiologic, behavioral, laboratory and health services research on a variety of STDs; provides program support, training and health communications for national STD prevention programs; and develops recommendations for HPV vaccines and implementation issues pertinent to such vaccines.

Goal 6, Performance Measure 1:
In 2005, the median chlamydia test positivity among 15-24 year-old women who were screened during visits to selected family planning clinics in all states and outlying areas was 6.3 percent (range: 3.0 percent to 20.3 percent). However, in nearly all states, chlamydia positivity was greater than the Healthy People 2010 objective of three percent. The source for the data is the CDC IPP. The continued expansion of screening programs to populations with higher prevalence of disease, use of more sensitive diagnostic tests, and high rates of reinfection from untreated sex partners likely contributed to the increase in overall median positivity. This measure has been revised for FY 2006 (see below).
Goal 6, Performance Measure 2:
The U.S. experienced a 74.3 percent decline in the reported rate of gonorrhea from 1975 to 1997. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1998.
Among women aged 15 to 44, the 2005 gonorrhea rate was 276 per 100,000 population, which is above the target rate of 250. Although increased screening (usually associated with simultaneous testing for chlamydial infection), use of more sensitive diagnostic tests, and improved reporting may account for a portion of the recent increase, true increases in disease in some populations and geographic areas also appear to have occurred. The source for these data is the STD Morbidity Surveillance System, CDC. This measure has been revised for FY 2006 (see below).

Goal 7, Performance Measure 1:
The rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in the U.S. declined by 89.7 percent from 1990 through 2000. In 2005, 93.8 percent of U.S. counties had an incidence of P&S syphilis in the population equal or below four per 100,000. Recent outbreaks of syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported, reflecting an increase in risky sexual behavior in this population and negatively affecting the significant reductions in P&S syphilis in the past decade. The rate of P&S syphilis increased slightly in 2005 from 2.7 in 2004 to 3.0 per 100,000 population. This increase was observed primarily in men (4.7 to 5.1 per 100,000 population), though syphilis rates in women increased slightly between 2004 and 2005 (0.8 to 0.9 per 100,000 population). Now that the data for FY 2005 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Goal 7, Performance Measure 2:
P&S syphilis remains an example of racial disparity in health, with 2005 rates among African Americans 5.4 times those among white Americans, down from a 64-fold differential at the beginning of the last decade. While substantially reduced from previous years, this disparity (5.4:1) is still much higher than that for other health outcomes: including infant mortality (2.5:1), and deaths attributable to heart disease (1.3:1). Communities burdened by poverty, racism, unemployment, low rates of health insurance, and inadequate access to healthcare are often disproportionately affected by syphilis. CDC aims to continue reducing this racial disparity. This measure has been revised for FY 2006 (see below).

Goal 8, Performance Measure 1:

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STD, AND TB PREVENTION

The continuing decrease in the rate of congenital syphilis likely reflects the substantial reduction in the rate of P&S syphilis among women that has occurred in the last decade. Between 1995 and 2005, the average yearly percentage decrease in the congenital syphilis rate was 15.8 percent. The average yearly percentage decrease in the rate of P&S syphilis reported among women for the years 1995 through 2005 was 16.0 percent. This measure has been revised for FY 2006 (see below).

Insufficient syphilis serologic testing and treatment of women for syphilis during pregnancy remains the major reason congenital syphilis persists in the U.S. When a woman has a syphilis infection during pregnancy, she may transmit the infection to the fetus in utero. This may result in fetal death or an infant born with physical and mental developmental disabilities. Most cases of congenital syphilis are easily preventable if women are screened for syphilis and treated early during prenatal care. Each positive test in a child is considered a medical emergency with immediate health services follow-up. The absence of testing is often related to complete lack of, or late initiation of, prenatal care. Between 2004 and 2005, the overall rate of congenital syphilis decreased 12.1 percent in the U.S., from 9.1 to 8.0 cases per 100,000 live births.

Goals 9 and 10:

During the FY 2006 (CY 2004) budget process, CDC's STD Prevention program underwent a PART review by the Office of Management and Budget. This process helped CDC redirect and refine its performance measures for STD prevention and control. Based on its PART review, CDC revised its goals for STD prevention. CDC will track the following goals and measures (Goals 9 and 10) and will no longer report on goals six through eight, after reporting for their FY 2005 targets has been completed.

Goal 9, Performance Measure 1:

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STD, AND TB PREVENTION

Data on the prevalence of chlamydial infection in defined populations have been useful to monitor disease burden and guide screening programs. For example, CDC monitors trends in prevalence among women enrolled in the U.S. Department of Labor National Job Training Program for economically disadvantaged women aged 16 to 24 who enter this program. Increased efforts to promote screening by medical practitioners are needed to achieve reductions in chlamydia in this and other populations. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

Goal 9, Performance Measure 2:

Chlamydia remains widespread and is a significant threat to women's health. Because chlamydia is usually asymptomatic and is most common among young women, CDC recommends annual chlamydia screening for sexually active women age 25 and under. This measure reflects chlamydia prevalence in programs receiving support from CDC. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

Goal 9, Performance Measure 3:

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most important preventable causes of infertility and potentially fatal tubal pregnancy. CDC conducts screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea to prevent PID from untreated infection. If not adequately treated, up to 40 percent of women infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea will develop infection (i.e., PID) in the uterus or fallopian tubes. PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. These measures reflect the importance of reducing this adverse health outcome. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

1 In FY 2002, the incidence of P&S syphilis in men was 3.8 per 100,000 (initial FY 2002 baseline). However, because of an outbreak of syphilis among men who have sex with men that occurred after 2002, CDC will report a new baseline for FY 2006. The overall goal for 2010 is a decrease in incidence of 12 percent as compared to the FY 2006 baseline.

Goal 10:

PERFORMANCE DETAIL INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STD, AND TB PREVENTION

Syphilis, a genital ulcerative disease, is highly infectious, but easily curable in its early (primary and secondary ­ P&S) stages. If untreated, it can lead to long-term complications including nerve, cardiovascular and organ damage and even death. Congenital syphilis (transmission from mother to child) can cause stillbirth, death soon after birth, physical deformity and neurological complications in children who survive. Syphilis also facilitates the spread of HIV, increasing transmission of the virus at least two-to-five fold.

Goal 10, Performance Measure 1a:

Although the rate of P&S syphilis in the U.S. declined by 89.7 percent during 1990-2000, the rate of P&S syphilis remained unchanged between 2000 and 2001, and increased annually since 2002. Overall increases in rates during 2001-2004 were observed only among men, but in 2005, there was also a slight increase in the rate among women. Recent outbreaks of syphilis occurring among MSM have been reported and have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behavior.

Goal 10, Performance Measure 1b:

Syphilis rates in women declined with the implementation of the Syphilis Elimination Plan (from 2.0/100,000 in 1999 to 0.9/100,000 in 2005). CDC will continue to strive to decrease syphilis cases among women, both to protect the health of women and to prevent congenital syphilis. Untreated early syphilis during pregnancy results in perinatal death in up to 40 percent of cases, and, if acquired during the four years preceding pregnancy, may lead to infection of the fetus in over 70 percent of cases. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

Goal 10, Performance Measure 2:

When a woman has a syphilis infection during pregnancy, she may transmit the infection to the fetus in utero. This often results in fetal death or an infant born with physical and mental developmental disabilities. Most cases of congenital syphilis are easily preventable if women are screened for syphilis and treated early during prenatal care. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

Goal 10, Performance Measure 3:

Syphilis remains an example of racial disparity in health, with 2005 rates among African Americans 5.4 times those among white Americans, down from a 64-fold differential at the beginning of the last decade. The racial disparity (5.4:1) is higher compared to many other health outcomes including infant mortality (2.5:1), and deaths attributable to heart disease (1.3:1). Communities burdened by poverty, racism, unemployment, low rates of health insurance, and inadequate access to healthcare are often disproportionately affected by syphilis. The FY 2008 target reflects what is achievable given current trends.

Data Source: Data are obtained from the national TB Surveillance System and the national Aggregate Reports for TB Program Evaluation.

Data Validation: TB morbidity data and related information submitted via the national TB Surveillance System are entered locally or at the state level into CDC-developed software which contains numerous data validation checks. Data received at CDC are reviewed to confirm their integrity and evaluate completeness. Routine data quality reports are generated to assess data completeness and identify inconsistencies.
Data submitted via the national Aggregate Reports for TB Program Evaluation are checked for accuracy and inconsistencies. Problems are resolved by CDC staff working with state and local TB program staff. During regular visits to state, local, and territorial health departments, CDC staff review TB registers and other records and data systems and compare records for verification and accuracy. At the end of each year, data are again reviewed before data and counts are finalized and published.

1Data reports come to CDC after therapy is completed, which can be as long as two years.
Goal 11, Performance Measure 1:
TB is a leading infectious killer of young adults worldwide, claiming the lives of more than two million people each year.
 Approximately one third of the world's population is latently infected with the bacterium that causes TB. An estimated
 10 to 15 million U.S. citizens have latent TB infection, and about 10 percent of these individuals will
 develop TB at some point in their lives. In 2005, TB cases declined for the 13th straight year and, from 2004 to 2005,
 reported cases of TB in the U.S. declined 2.9 percent (from 14, 515 to 14,097). Persons born outside the U.S. now
 account for more than half of all U.S. TB cases.

Goal 11, Performance Measure 2:
Because completion of TB treatment is the most effective way to reduce the spread of TB and prevent its complications, this objective is the highest priority for CDC's TB program. Its achievement is vital to reduce TB cases and to eventually eliminate TB. Patients who do not complete therapy within 12 months are often difficult to treat and require numerous interventions. Significant new efforts must be made to achieve this objective. CDC supports outreach workers, hired from language, cultural, and ethnic groups with high TB incidence to help meet this objective.

Outreach workers help patients complete treatment through directly observed therapy incentives and other adherence strategies. CDC and the CDC-funded Model TB Centers also design and implement training and educational aids for health department and healthcare providers to improve the skills they need to help achieve this objective. The proportion of persons who complete a curative course of treatment within 12 months of initiation rose from 67.6% in 1999 to 81.5% in 2003, however, improvement in this area is still needed.
Goal 11, Performance Measure 3:
Healthcare providers must know if a newly diagnosed infectious patient is infected with drug-sensitive or drug- resistant organisms so that appropriate drug therapy can be initiated. If this information is unknown, patients may receive inadequate treatment leading to the spread of drug-resistant organisms, additional morbidity, and mortality. The percentage of TB patients with initial positive cultures who have drug susceptibility results has increased dramatically over the past decade, from 74.7% in 1994 to 94.6% in 2005. Progress towards this measure is attributable to increased efforts of state and local health departments and hospital infection-control practitioners to address the resurgence of TB and increased funding for health department laboratories to purchase state-of-the-art equipment needed to perform more accurate and rapid laboratory testing and confirmation for TB and multi-drug resistant TB.
Goal 11, Performance Measure 4:
Completion of treatment for latent TB infection among contacts of infectious TB cases is a cornerstone of U.S. efforts to reduce TB and eliminate the disease, second only to ensuring that those with active TB complete treatment with appropriate drugs. Contacts of smear-positive TB patients are at high risk of developing TB and therefore must be screened for infection. If infected, these contacts should be offered complete treatment for latent infection. Performance reporting dates for FY 2002 ­ 2006 have been revised to accurately reflect the time lag in reporting data to CDC. In 2000, CDC adopted a new system for reporting on this measure. As a result, baseline data is substantially lower than that gathered under the previous system. Previous targets were set with a different data system which reflected a much higher baseline. The FY 2007 and FY 2008 targets have been revised in consideration of the new baseline data.
Through cooperative agreements with state and local health departments, CDC supports identifying and examining contacts of persons with active TB, as well as completing treatment for contacts who have latent TB infection. CDC is designing training for health department TB staff to improve their skills in this area. CDC is also working with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and other federally funded programs serving groups at high risk for TB to facilitate testing and completion of treatment of latent TB infection.

Goal 12, Performance Measure 1:
CDC is on track to achieve the long-term target for hepatitis A. Overall, hepatitis A rates have declined dramatically; more than 78 percent since the last nationwide outbreak in 1995. The Healthy People 2010 target for reducing hepatitis A rates, 4.5 new cases per 100,000 population, was achieved in 2001. The rate in 2005, 1.9 new cases per 100,000 population, is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance for hepatitis A began in 1966. This precipitous decline in hepatitis A rates has coincided with the implementation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) recommendations for use of hepatitis A vaccine for the prevention and control of hepatitis A.

In 2006, ACIP stated that elimination of indigenous HAV transmission in the U.S. was an attainable goal and recommended universal vaccination of all children at one year of age (e.g. 12 - 23 months) for HAV. Although increases in rates may still occur, it is expected that the downward trend in rates will continue with ongoing implementation of the ACIP vaccination strategy. Reporting dates for FY 2006, FY 2007 and FY 2008 have been extended as the data will be available in July of 2007. The FY 2006 result will be reported in July of 2007.

Efficiency Measure 1:
PulseNet, an early warning system for outbreaks of foodborne disease, is a national network of public health laboratories that performs DNA fingerprinting on bacteria that may be foodborne. This network identifies and labels each disease-causing organism by its fingerprint pattern and rapidly compares new patterns to those existing in the electronic database at CDC to identify related strains. The DNA fingerprinting can distinguish strains of disease-causing organisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, Shigella, and Listeria, allowing early detection of disease clusters.
Currently, databases are available for E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella, and Campylobacter. CDC will increase the number of online submissions between 2006 and 2008 by increasing the number of individuals at the participating laboratories who are certified to electronically submit pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns directly to the database.

A summary of FoodNet data from 1996 to 2005 published on April 14, 2006, showed significant declines in rates of infection with E. coli O157, Listeria, and Campylobacter, suggesting the current efforts to reduce these diseases are largely on track toward the Healthy People 2010 objectives. Rates of infection with Salmonella have only modestly decreased. This may reflect increasing Salmonella contamination in poultry and challenges related to fresh produce. New interagency efforts in research and interventions to improve the effectiveness of food safety measures for Salmonella are now underway. CDC, in collaboration with FDA, began broad implementation of a national Listeria Action Plan to further reduce Listeria cases through efficient risk management, by empowering consumers and improving consumer safety.

Goal 1, Performance Measures 1 and 3:
The number of courses of antibiotics given for ear infections to children under five years of age declined from 63 courses per 100 population in 2002 to 53 courses per 100 population in 2003 and decreased further to 42 per 100 population in 2004. Data from 2005 show a slight increase; however, the goal is still exceeded. Data show that antibiotic prescriptions for ear infections in children under five have declined considerably, compared to the 1997 baseline of 69 courses. Measure 1 will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006. Reporting dates for both measures 1 and 3 were extended to November in order to give the appropriate time to collect and report data accurately.
CDC's public health campaign "Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work" is the focus of this measure. The campaign involves an alliance of partners working to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and reduce the spread of resistance to antibiotics. This national campaign includes a series of television, radio, and print public service announcements and comprehensive national, state, and local outreach. For example, in September 2003, CDC launched a national ad campaign created to promote appropriate antibiotics use knowledge among parents, which generated over 90 million audience impressions through television, print, and online media. Other current campaign activities include funding states to develop, implement, and evaluate local campaigns and evaluating and promoting a medical school curriculum on appropriate use of antibiotics. In addition, the National Committee for Quality Assurance's Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) now includes two measures on appropriate antibiotic use, promoted through the campaign.
In May 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians issued new guidelines for the management of ear infections. These guidelines present an option of observing selected children with ear infections without prescribing an antibiotic. CDC expects that as these guidelines are implemented prescribing antibiotics for ear infections will decline, accelerating movement toward achieving this goal.

Data Source: LRN labs report Proficiency Testing (PT) data to LRN secure website. Grading and summary of results are maintained on LRN website. Data Validation: All of PT results are reviewed to meet grading criteria: 1. Proper identification of agent in the samples that contain the agent; 2. Ability of LRN labs to follow appropriate algorithm for obtaining results; 3. Ability to report with prescribed timelines. Automated grading tool is used to calculate PT passing rates. Designated individual review PT grading for errors. Cross Reference: HHS-4, 5, PART, 500-4 Goal 3, Performance Measure 1: The purpose of proficiency testing (PT) is to determine if LRN laboratories are continuously able to accurately identify the biological agents that may appear in naturally-occurring outbreaks or that may be used as agents of bioterrorism by using the instruments and protocols employed by the LRN. CDC provides a special PT program to each LRN laboratory that is, in turn, required to successfully participate. With each event, the PT program sends one or more select agents to each laboratory as pure cultures, genetic fragments, or substances embedded in a sample matrix mimicking an environmental powder or other sample. Laboratories are challenged to provide the correct genus and species answer using the established protocols within a limited and specified timeframe. The cumulative PT score for a year is calculated by averaging the scores from each quarterly PT and then at the end of the year, calculating a national average from the total number of sites that participate in the program. The PT program has been in place since the LRN was initiated in 1999. At the onset of the program, very few state laboratories were able to rapidly and accurately identify biological and select agents. Because of the difficulty in identifying certain select agents and logistical issues, the success rate in 2003 was about 75 percent. In order to achieve a goal of a cumulative average of 90 percent or greater for all labs in the LRN, it is necessary to maintain constant communication regarding the standard operating plan regarding specimen analysis, to provide updates on protocols, to provide remediation and training to those laboratories that do not achieve the 95 percent goal, and to engage the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) to assist in achieving this national goal. APHL has agreed to assume responsibility for monitoring its members. By the middle of FY 2005 the average was only 83 percent accuracy (88 percent by the end of FY 2005). Because of these averages, and because some organisms are very difficult to identify, the goal of reaching and maintaining 90 percent on a national scale is ambitious. While the goal of the LRN is to achieve a 100 percent accuracy rate, it is reasonable to assume that successful participation on a national scale would entail a success rate of 90 percent or greater accuracy.

Cross Reference: Measure 1 - HHS-5, 8; Measure 2 ­ HHS-5, 8, PART

Efficiency Measure 1:
As project officers focus less on program administration, they spend more time providing program consulting, which increases the level of efficiency of a project officer. As such, this measure defines the number of management information systems within divisions that project officers use to provide more efficient program consulting to recipients. Currently, staff and recipients use the following six information systems to collect programmatic information: (1) Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Management Information System (REACH MIS), (2) Office of Smoking and Health's (OSH) National Tobacco Control Program Chronicle, (3) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) Minimum Data Elements (MDE), (4) Division of Diabetes Translation Management Information System, (5) Prevention Research Center Information System and (6) Heart Disease and Stroke Management Information System. The NBCCEDP System for Technical Assistance Reporting (STAR) to report programmatic infrastructure data has been discontinued following an internal evaluation of the efficiency and usefulness of the data collection. Due to the development of a Center-wide efficiency measure during the PART process, this measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Additionally, efficiency measures previously reported for Breast and Cervical Cancer prevention and Diabetes have been subsumed into the new Center-wide efficiency measure. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Efficiency Measure 2:
Approximately 85 percent of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's (NCCDPHP) budget is spent on extramural funding of grantees and cooperative agreement partners, especially state health departments. These grantees and partners utilize funding to conduct interventions that directly impact the health of the nation. Any delay in receipt of funding results in reduction of the number or duration of the interventions, which, in turn, affects the health impact of our grantees' activities.
Based on recent implementation of a Project Officer training course, increased use of Management Information Systems to track these actions, and increased emphasis on technical assistance, the program will decrease these budget actions each year. Targets reflect a five percent decrease from baseline per year.

1The heart disease measures for 2003 were inadvertently not included in the 2003 plan. Whereas 2003 dollars support the measures identified, 2003 targets were not provided.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:

Program activities are in place to achieve the performance measure of decreasing the proportion of heart disease and stroke pre-transport deaths. They include national and state-level health communication programs which cover symptom awareness and the need to call 911 for emergency transport. Intra and inter-state stroke networks, coalitions, and signs and symptoms campaigns have been developed. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:

Program activities to achieve the performance measure of reducing the prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure among high-risk populations and patients with hypertension include collaborations between states and their Federally Qualified Community Health Centers, which provide healthcare to underserved, uninsured, and minority populations. To date, states have assisted health centers in conducting needs assessments, and providing hypertension training and educational assistance for providers related to national guidelines for hypertension care and prevention.

Community health centers continue to enhance and align their systems and practices with evidence-based recommendations to reduce heart disease and stroke risk factors. In FY 2006, HRSA merged the Cardiovascular Health Collaborative with the Diabetes Collaborative. Training and startup time led to a decrease in the desired effect. With the completion of the merger and training, it is anticipated that these results will improve. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:

Beginning in 2003, CDC moved to calculating this rate based on a rolling three-year timeframe rather than cumulative data (for instance, the FY 2003 rate reflects data for the time period 2001­2003). Using a three-year period ensures statistical stability in the rate.

Goal 3, Performance Measure 2:

PERFORMANCE DETAIL HEALTH PROMOTION
CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND GENOMICS

CDC encourages programs to reach underserved women for screening, including women who are rarely or never screened for cervical cancer. CDC defines "never or rarely screened" women as those who have not had a Pap test within the past five years. In FY 2004, 22.1 percent of newly enrolled women were rarely or never screened, just below our target of 22.5 percent and an increase from FY 2003. Because the measure relates only to newly enrolled women, projects must enroll new, rarely, and never screened women each year to meet this target. Therefore, it is a challenging target to achieve over time because programs must continually tap into communities to identify those who are rarely or never screened. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 3:
In FY 2004, 80.7 percent of women with abnormal breast cancer screening results and 62.6 percent of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening results received a final diagnosis within 60 days. The FY 2004 figures represent a decrease in breast and increase in cervical timeliness of diagnostic follow-up over the FY 2003 figures. The comparatively lower percentage for cervical cancer screening reflects challenges facing CDC's programs, including delays in Pap results reporting from laboratories, long waiting periods for appointments for diagnostic services, and difficulties in tracking "hard to reach" women. Successful recall of women for diagnostic evaluation following unsuccessful earlier attempts will improve rates for completeness of follow-up, though negatively impacting timeliness. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 4:
With the rapid expansion of screening services provided by the program (Goal 3, Measure 1), rates of timeliness to treatment fell short of targets. In FY 2004, 93.1 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer and 87.6 percent of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer initiated treatment within 60 days. This is a slight improvement over FY 2003 for breast cancer and decline for cervical cancer. Rates and percentages are more stable when calculated from large numbers. Because the number of invasive cancer cases diagnosed through the program in FY 2004 is small (201 cases), trends based on annual measures for cervical cancer trends may be difficult to interpret. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 5:
For women diagnosed with precancerous cervical lesions, CDC has set a target of ensuring the start of treatment within 90 days to 94 percent in 2004 and 94.5 percent in FY 2005. In 2000, the baseline for women diagnosed with precancerous cervical lesions that start treatment within 90 days was established at 92.5 percent. With the rapid expansion of screening services provided by the program (Goal 3, Measure 1), rates of timeliness to treatment fell short of targets. In FY 2004, the percentage of women with precancerous lesions who started treatment within 90 days of diagnosis was 90.4 percent, an increase from FY 2003. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.

Data Source: Data on receipt of annual eye and foot exams in persons with diabetes is collected through BRFSS.
Data Validation: More than 30 validity and reliability studies attest to the quality and validity of data derived from the BRFSS. CDC verifies performance through quarterly state reports and periodic site visits. For efforts in American Indian/Alaska Native populations, data are verified via program reports and documentation of support. Also, CDC staff work closely with the Indian Health Service in validating data pertaining to American Indian/Alaskan Natives.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
In FY 2003, CDC began analyzing the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for this measure. Rather than focusing solely on basic implementation DPCPs, CDC now analyzes data from all the basic implementation and capacity building DPCPs participating in the BRFSS. CDC is now also using adjusted data rather than crude data.
Dilated eye exams leveled off in FY 2003 and dropped slightly in FY 2005. This may be due to a number of factors, including a possible increase in the use of fundus photography, a new technology that does not require dilation. For this reason, CDC is considering revising the BRFSS question which measures this objective. Also, recent studies have suggested that dilated eye exams performed every two years instead of annually are sufficient to prevent blindness from diabetic retinopathy in those without the condition. CDC continues to work with the state DPCPs to influence the preventive care practices of health systems and to inform providers and persons with diabetes about the importance of receiving annual eye exams to discover and treat diabetes-related eye disease in the earliest stages. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 2:
This measure captures funded states progress in increasing A1c testing rates to the recommended level. The A1c test (short for hemoglobin A1c) measures blood glucose (sugar) control over the last three months. The suggested target for people with diabetes is seven percent; however, many people with diabetes have levels of nine percent or higher. Reducing blood glucose levels by just one percent among people with diabetes reduces their risk for microvascular complications (eye, kidney, and nerve disease) by 40 percent. This measure reflects the evolution of CDC's focus from process outputs to intermediate impact outcomes. There has been no clear trend in A1c testing over the last five years as rates have fluctuated slightly from year to year. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 3:
CDC and its state-based DPCPs work with HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) to improve diabetes and pre-diabetes performance measures through improved care delivery systems, increased access, and decreased health disparities among medically underserved populations. The Diabetes Prevention Collaborative prototype involves five federally funded health centers and five DPCPs from across the country. The objectives of the Diabetes Prevention Collaborative are to identify the pre-diabetes population and those at highest risk for developing diabetes, and provide evidence-based lifestyle interventions to prevent and/or delay the progression to diabetes. Preliminary findings indicate that methods to identify the pre- diabetes population are effective. Lifestyle interventions are being tested for their effect on reaching population level goals of more than seven percent weight loss and more than 150 minutes of exercise per week.
To date, 2,387 individuals who have met the risk criteria for pre-diabetes have received an oral glucose tolerance test; more than half of these individuals (1,392) were found to have either pre-diabetes or previously undiagnosed diabetes. The collaborative shows that better outcomes in diabetes care and prevention are possible when the focus is on empowering individuals, improving the health care delivery system, and linking to communities where people live. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.

Data Source: CDC monitors cigarette use among youth and reports performance on a biennial basis using the national Youth Risk Behavior
Survey (YRBS). Three additional surveys, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey, and the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), provide complementary data for examining trends and understanding youth-related tobacco issues. The NSDUH is conducted annually by SAMHSA; the MTF is conducted annually by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, and funded by NIDA. The NYTS is conducted by CDC.

Data Validation: Following procedures developed by CDC staff, the NYTS data collection and survey support contractor, Macro International
Inc. (Macro) checked each student's responses to certain questionnaire items for consistency with other items. Upon receipt of the final cleaned 2004 NYTS data set from Macro, CDC staff conducted quality checks of data quality, survey design, and weighting.

1 YRBSS (Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System) data released in June 2004 indicated achievement of the FY 2003 target, and CDC revised the teen smoking projections.

Goal 5, Performance Measure 1:

Between 1991 and 1997, the prevalence of current cigarette use among youth (grades nine ­ twelve) increased from 27.5 percent to 36.4 percent. Since 1997, cigarette use among adolescents has declined substantially, and in 2003, this rate was at the lowest level since national surveys have been monitoring youth smoking. Factors that contributed to the decline included: 1) a 90 percent increase in the retail price of cigarettes from December 1997-May 2003, 2) increases in school-based efforts to prevent tobacco use, and 3) an increase in the proportion of young persons exposed through the mass media to smoking-prevention campaigns. All of these factors are components and/or recommendations of CDC's National Tobacco Control Program. However, the 2005 YRBS and other youth tobacco use surveys indicate that since 2003 this observed rate of decline may be reversing. From 2002 to 2004, factors preventing tobacco use (e.g., increasing the retail price of tobacco products, implementing smoking-prevention media campaigns, and funding for comprehensive state tobacco prevention and control programs) have declined. Meanwhile tobacco industry expenditures on tobacco advertising and promotion have been increasing, from $5.7 billion in 1997 to $15.2 billion in 2003. The emerging data underscore the need to fully implement evidence-based strategies that are effective in preventing youth tobacco use in order to continue progress toward meeting the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing smoking among high school youth to 16 percent. Now that the data for FY 2005 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Since the inception of the program in FY 1999, funded states have been forming statewide coalitions, developing statewide action plans, and initiating and evaluating interventions. State partners include public health organizations, food producers and marketers, medical and education providers, parks and recreation, transportation, and urban planning agencies, local media, and communities. All states are developing, implementing and evaluating nutrition and physical activity health promotion interventions to address overweight and chronic disease in specific populations. At a minimum, these interventions are grounded in theory, have a defined purpose with clearly stated expected outcomes, have a defined methodology and strategy for implementation, and an evaluation component. In addition, these interventions are designed to:

· Establish supportive environments, making healthier lifestyle options (i.e., healthy eating and physical activity) in communities more readily accessible, affordable, comfortable, and safe.

· Establish policies and standards to support healthy eating and physical activity in communities.

· Establish programs in communities to increase physical activity and/or reduce caloric intake through healthy eating habits.

Goal 8, Performance Measure 1:
CDC continues to work towards the development of national strategies (recommendations) for eliminating gaps in each of the six health priority areas based on the interventions and findings from the REACH 2010 Projects.
The dissemination of the most promising strategies and of lessons learned is critical to the overall effectiveness of this project. Preliminary measures have been taken to assess the dissemination strategies used by other programs at CDC. Partners that are critical in developing the dissemination plan include the funded communities, evaluation experts, external consultants, private partners, and other federal agencies. Grantee meetings were held in October 2005 and June 2006. In FY 2006, the grantee technical assistance and evaluation workshop attendees rotated in six workgroups to share and begin to synthesize results from their evidence-based and practice-based work. Dissemination work includes the REACH video Success Stories from Our Communities, which will serve as a mechanism to share lessons learned from the REACH program that can be applied by community leaders, public health and community services professionals, faith-based communities, and policy makers to reduce and eliminate health disparities that exist within their communities. In addition, special issues of three scientific journals focusing on the REACH 2010 findings were published: Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved (May 2006), Preventing Chronic Disease (July 2006), and Health Promotion Practice (July 2006).
Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Goal 8, Performance Measure 2:
The evaluation of REACH 2010 is of critical importance in determining the program's effectiveness in reducing health disparities. Working with its grantees and partners, CDC has developed an evaluation model that guides the collection of qualitative and quantitative data.
Between FY 2002 and FY 2005, the REACH 2010 Risk Factor Surveys were conducted in the 27 of the 40 REACH communities in which the health priority areas are breast and cervical cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Communities that are focusing on cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes show that the proportion of Hispanics having cholesterol checks increased by 40 percent as compared to a small decline in the general U.S. population; the proportion of hypertensive American Indians on medication increased by ten percent compared to a six percent increase nationally; cigarette smoking among Asian American men decreased by more than 30 percent versus a six percent decline nationally, and the proportion of African Americans that have had their cholesterol checked increased compared to a small decline nationally.
The results of this data collection were disseminated to these 27 communities at the REACH 2010 Technical Assistant Workshop (October 3-5, 2005). The CD-ROMs which contain the combined four-year data and support documents were also distributed to grantees.
In addition, CDC has collected and disseminated qualitative data related to three stages of the REACH 2010 Evaluation Logic Model: (1) community capacity-building activities, (2) intervention strategies, and (3) systems change, and change among change agents. Information was collected through an internet-based data warehousing application called the REACH Information Network (REACH IN). REACH grantees use the system to document current resources, identify specific needs, and document efforts and outcomes. The system allows funded communities and CDC to monitor indicator outcomes related to specific health priority areas.
Eighty-five percent of REACH 2010 communities have collected qualitative data in the REACH IN system for dissemination. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:
Cancer is the second leading cause of death among all Americans, and breast cancer accounts for about 15 percent of cancer deaths among women. The program's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), developed in response to The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, contributes to the achievement of this mission by improving access to and the quality of breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection services nationwide.
Breast cancer mortality is declining steadily while incidence is increasing slightly. The decline in mortality is attributable in approximately equal parts to earlier detection through mammography screening and improved treatment. Consequently, continued increases in mammography should contribute to a continue decrease in mortality.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
Timely mammography screening among women aged 40 years or older is the best available method to detect breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stage, and could reduce breast cancer mortality by approximately 16 percent to 30 percent compared with women who are not screened.
Based on annual rates of increase in the 1990's, and the recent leveling-off of the increase in mammography use since the late 1990's, these projected increases would be challenging, yet achievable.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 3:
Cancer is the second leading cause of death among all Americans, and cervical cancer accounts for about 1.5 percent of cancer deaths among women. Sixty percent of the invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in this country is found among women who have never been screened, or have not been screened in the last five years.
Deaths from this disease occur disproportionately among women who are uninsured or underinsured. NBCCEDP helps low-income, uninsured, and under-served women gain access to lifesaving screening programs for the early detection of breast and cervical cancers and precancerous lesions. Pap tests funded by the NBCCEDP can find cervical cancer at an early stage when it is most curable or even prevent the disease if precancerous lesions found during the test are treated.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
Cancer is the second leading cause of death among all Americans, and lung, trachea, and bronchus cancers account for 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses and 29 percent of all cancer deaths. Since 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health have concluded that smoking is a primary cause of lung cancer, and since 1986 have concluded that exposure to secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers. Prior to the baseline year of 2003, mortality rates from lung cancer were decreasing steadily.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 2:
Since 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health have concluded that smoking is a primary cause of lung cancer. National trends in per capita cigarette consumption are strongly correlated with national trends in lung cancer mortality rates and consumption trends are recommended as a primary surveillance indicator for lung cancer control efforts.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL HEALTH PROMOTION
CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND GENOMICS

End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complicated and disabling condition and one of the most expensive conditions for which the federal government provides financial coverage. Diabetes mellitus is presently the most common cause of ESRD in the U.S., accounting for approximately 45 percent to 50 percent of all cases of ESRD.
For decades, ESRD incidence was increasing. Since the late 1990's, the rates have declined. As those with diabetes live longer, the incidence of ESRD is likely to increase. Therefore, CDC aims to maintain the current baseline rate.

Goal 3, Performance Measure 2:

End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complicated and disabling condition and one of the most expensive conditions for which the federal government provides financial coverage. Glucose control is one important pathophysiologic factor in the genesis of ESRD. As A1C measurement is the best indicator of glucose control, the annual measure of A1C relates closely to the likelihood of achieving the long-term measure of controlling the rate of ESRD among persons with diabetes.

CDC aims to increase the age-adjusted proportion of persons with diabetes who receive two or more A1C tests by 1 percentage point every year.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
Currently, Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the single largest killer of Americans, causing one of every five deaths in the U.S. in 2003. It is estimated that 700,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack and about 500,000 will have a recurrent attack. Stroke ranks number three among all causes of death, accounting for about one of every 15 deaths in the U.S. in 2003. Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke.
CHD death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1995. Stroke rates have been fairly stable since 1998.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 2:
Hypertension affects approximately 65 million adults (nearly one in three) in the U.S. and is the most common primary diagnosis in America. The relationship between blood pressure and the risk of CVD events is consistent and independent of other factors. The higher the blood pressure, the greater is the chance of heart attack, heart failure,

stroke, and kidney disease. About 69 percent of people who have a first heart attack, 77 percent who have a first stroke, and 74 percent who have congestive heart failure have hypertension.
Prior to 2000, data for this measure was collected sporadically. In order to reach the target, high blood pressure control should increase by approximately 4.5 percentage points per year. Annual targets reflect that increase.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 3:
Approximately 38 million American adults have blood cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dL or higher, which is considered high risk. Lowering cholesterol can reduce the risk for developing heart disease, including heart attacks, and, among those with heart disease, the need for heart bypass surgery or angioplasty. Recent studies show that high levels of LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides increase the risk of stroke in people with previous coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Low levels of HDL ("good" cholesterol) may also raise stroke risk.
Although the objective of 17 percent was reached during 1999-2002, the estimate is expected to increase with the emerging epidemic of obesity. The annual targets reflect maintenance at the current level.

Goal 5, Performance Measure 1:
Major causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. are related to physical inactivity and poor diet. In particular, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers are linked to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.
There has been an absolute decline from 29 percent to 24 percent in the past ten years. Rate of decrease is expected to lessen over the next ten years.
Goal 5, Performance Measure 2:
About 60 million adults, or 30 percent of the adult population, are now obese. Obesity is related to two-thirds of diabetes cases and of heart disease cases, 20 percent of cancers in women and 15 percent of cancers in men. Additionally, it causes or exacerbates many other serious chronic diseases and conditions, including hypertension and stroke.
Rates of obesity have been increasing at the rate of approximately 0.64 percentage points per year during the years 2002 through 2004. CDC aims to slow the rate of growth in obesity rates.

In 2004, an estimated 7,761 young people were living with AIDS, a 42 percent increase since 2000, and an estimated 3,867 young people received a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, representing about 12 percent of the persons given a diagnosis during that year. Young men who have sex with men, especially those of minority races or ethnicities, were at high risk for HIV infection.
Goal 6, Performance Measure 2:
Each year there are approximately 19 million new STD infections in the U.S. and almost half of them are among youth ages 15 to 24. Thirty-four percent of young women ­ approximately 820,000 each year ­ become pregnant at least once before the age of 20. Data from the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) show that 47 percent of high school students had had sexual intercourse, Fourteen percent of high school students had four or more sex partners during their lifetime, and 37 percent of sexually active high school students did not use a condom at last intercourse. STDs (including HIV) among youth result in substantial economic burden to our society. The total estimated burden of the nine million new cases of STDs that occurred among 15 to 24-year-olds in 2000 was $6.5 billion (in year 2000 dollars).
Goal 6, Performance Measure 3:
Cancer is the second leading cause of death among all Americans, and lung, trachea, and bronchus cancers account for 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses and 29 percent of all cancer deaths. Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), has been determined to be a known human carcinogen. Persistent exposure to ETS is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. Since 1986, the U.S. Surgeon General's reports have concluded that exposure to secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers.
The program provides national leadership for a comprehensive, broad-based approach to reducing tobacco use which involves: preventing young people from starting to smoke; eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke; promoting quitting; and, identifying and eliminating disparities in tobacco use among population groups. It also develops health communication campaigns aimed at informing the public about the health risks associated with environmental tobacco smoke and reducing disparities in these exposures.
Prior to the baseline time period, this measure was declining steadily, with significant progress between the end of NHANES III (1988-1994) and the most recent NHANES (1999-2002).

CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND GENOMICS Goal 6, Performance Measure 4: Increased physical activity--whether through structured (e.g., organized recreation or sports) or unstructured (e.g., recess, free play) opportunities--helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases and prevent excess weight gain among children and adolescents. Physical activity is a critical component of obesity prevention efforts, as those adolescents who are already overweight are at an increased risk --70 percent chance--of becoming overweight and obese adults. Chronic diseases and obesity in adulthood are even more likely if overweight existed in adolescence, thereby increasing the likelihood of adults suffering from multiple comorbidities, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

Efficiency Measure 1:
CDC supports Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology in six states. These Centers (including CDC's own model tracking program in Atlanta) track autism and other developmental disabilities and conduct public health research into the causes of autism. These efforts are essential for CDC to fulfill its Congressional mandate to collect, analyze, and disseminate autism data. The successful establishment of an ongoing data management center for these sites has resulted in significant time savings. Now that the data for FY 2005 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Efficiency Measure 2:
Following the establishment of a data management center for developmental disabilities, CDC will be able to track progress in this area by focusing on increasing the number of autism cases included in the Data Coordinating Center, thus saving program and staff time and expediting efforts to understand the prevalence and causes of autism. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Efficiency Measure 3:
In FY 2005, CDC spent over 60 percent of its budget on cooperative agreements and grants. Because awarding of cooperative agreements and grants involves a 25 step process, executing the award process efficiently and accurately is of critical importance. Increased accuracy and timeliness of the awarding process will allow grantees to optimize use of funds and increase the probability of fully executed awards during the project period. In addition, the program will save work hours expensed through repetitive processes. Ultimately, the goal of the expeditious disbursement of funds will promote implementation of public health interventions designed to improve the nation's health. In FY 2005 (baseline), 64 percent of new competitive cooperative agreements/grants were processed within the target of 176 days.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:
CDC funds programs designed to build statewide capacity in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) prevention and monitoring; a collaborative research consortium for identifying, developing, and evaluating effective strategies for intervening with children and/or adolescents with FAS and related conditions; research programs to identify and test new FAS prevention and management methods; regional training centers to increase health care providers' knowledge about how to present FAS; and education materials for parents, educators and social service providers about accessing appropriate diagnostic and treatment services for affected children and their families. In addition, CDC provides support to all 50 states to monitor alcohol consumption levels, and support targeted outreach to Cherokee nation. CDC met and exceeded the FY 2003 target, with 10.6 percent of women reporting alcohol consumption during pregnancy. However, in FY 2004, the target was not met. CDC is implementing a recently- proven successful intervention to reach high-risk women. CDC anticipates that this intervention will contribute to reducing rates of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
Fortification of the food supply with folic acid (a B vitamin) has allowed major reductions in the rates of serious neural tube birth defects of the spine (spina bifida) and brain (anencephaly). However, more reductions are possible if all women of reproductive age consume adequate amounts of folic acid before, and during, pregnancy. CDC published data documenting the effectiveness of folic acid fortification in preventing spina bifida and anencephaly. Data from birth defects monitoring programs showed that, as a result of fortification, approximately 1,000 more babies are born without these defects each year. Data show the number of children born with these defects were 1,709 in 2002, an 11.5 percent decrease from the 2000 baseline of 1,932. Data from 2003, however, show the number of cases increasing to 2,021, leaving this target unmet for this year. While an increase from one year to the next does not necessarily mean a reversal in the trend of declining rates, CDC has published an analysis documenting declining levels of blood folate among women of childbearing age. It is unclear of the exact reason for the decline (however, popularity of low carbohydrate diets may contribute) but decreased consumption of folic acid would negatively affect rates of folic acid-preventable birth defects. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 3:
Increasing the number of births covered by monitoring programs increases the quality of the data, which can then be used more effectively to draw programmatic and scientific conclusions. Establishing prevalence rates will help CDC to more effectively allocate resources, develop prevention strategies, and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Similarly, the ability to detect regional differences in prevalence rates will give CDC important information about risk factors and causes of birth defects. CDC publishes data from the monitoring programs in its annual congenital malformations report. In FY 2006, CDC worked to increase the number of births covered by birth defects monitoring programs by guiding and funding states to build and strengthen birth defects surveillance systems. While the number of births did increase in FY 2006, the target was not met. CDC will continue to fund state birth defects surveillance programs which support the NBDPN, a collaboration of individuals working at the local, state and national levels in birth defects surveillance, research and prevention. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 4:
This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process.
Because the birth defects system is more mature and able to be assessed numerically, investments in the developmental disabilities systems are needed to measure the same level (a study was developed in 2004 and initiated in 2005). However, the model for the birth defects and developmental disabilities surveillance systems is based on the same methodology. CDC projects baseline data will be available by the end of 2007 for Birth Defects and in 2009 for Developmental Disabilities. For birth defects, the target percentage is a measure of sensitivity. For developmental disabilities, the measure is initially based on establishing the baseline probability that a true developmental disability is identified by the program's model system.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 5:
This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process.
Understanding the role of modifiable risk and preventive factors in the etiology of birth defects and developmental disabilities provides an important opportunity for prevention. As prior investments in the research infrastructure for birth defects is more mature, initial efforts for annual performance measures focus on publication of research findings from this system. Meanwhile, the infrastructure for research on autism and other developmental disabilities research is being established. This research infrastructure follows the same model as birth defects but is in the early stages of development, with initial publication of findings expected in 2012.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 6:
This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process.
Pregnancies and births affected by spina bifida and anencephaly have profound physical, emotional, and financial effects on families and communities. Since food fortification began in 1998, thousands of babies are being born in the U.S. without these serious birth defects. However, analyses by racial and ethnic groups found that while fortification lowered rates significantly among all racial and ethnic groups, a disparity with respect to Hispanics has persisted. CDC is currently focusing on developing and implementing evidence-based strategies to reduce the occurrence of these birth defects among Hispanics. Targets are based on the concept of diminishing returns, the understanding that preventing the earlier cases was easier than preventing the latter cases. For example, in 1996  2000, rates declined by 36 percent. As it became increasingly difficult to prevent cases with existing strategies, more intensive efforts were required to achieve the same level of reductions. Thus, for the next five year period (2001 2005), targets were set based on a proposed 18 percent decline in rates (half of 36 percent). Similarly, for the subsequent five years (2006-2010), CDC set targets based on a proposed decline of an additional 9 percent (one-half

of 18 percent) from 2005. Unfortunately, data for 2003 reveal an increase in the rate of these birth defects among the Hispanic population. These data further underscore the importance of targeted efforts to address the high rates among Hispanics. CDC's two priority activities in this area are developing and disseminating targeted campaign materials and working with partners to explore the addition of folic acid to corn flour products.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 7:

This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process.

Implementing intervention strategies to reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy is an important component of reducing the occurrence of alcohol-related birth defects and developmental disabilities, including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Research shows that 1) provider-based screening of women of childbearing age at risk of having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, and 2) provider-based interventions for women at risk are effective strategies for reducing alcohol-exposed pregnancies. CDC has begun to translate research findings through the development and publication of targeted recommendations on provider-based screening and interventions for women of childbearing age. CDC has developed a quick-reference clinician tool to facilitate screening and interventions among providers. As of December, 2006, over 4,000 toolkits have been disseminated. Through education about and implementation of this tool, CDC aims to improve the percentage of health care providers who screen women of childbearing age for risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy and provide appropriate interventions for those at risk.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
CDC is collaborating with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to help states implement the new Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program. CDC helps states establish programs to track children who screen positive for hearing loss and ensure that these children get follow-up diagnostic testing and, if needed, enter early intervention programs. At this early stage in the program, CDC targets efforts to measure the impact of the first and second phases in this process to track the number of children initially screened for hearing loss in the hospital and the number evaluated by a trained audiologist to confirm or deny screening results. Even this seemingly small step involves multiple places where children with hearing loss can be "lost to follow-up," and is essential for the achievement of targets. To help reduce the burden on states and create a central source of data, CDC, in collaboration with key partners, has designed a standardized form to gather aggregate level EHDI-related data, including "lost to follow-up." In FY 2003, CDC exceeded its target with 31 percent of newborns that screen positive for hearing loss but are lost to follow-up. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 2:
CDC supports research and other programs to improve health and quality of life among people of all ages with disabilities. The primary goals of the research component are to identify risk and protective factors, develop effective prevention strategies, and assess the cost-effectiveness of health promotion interventions. One such intervention, "Living Well with a Disability," has demonstrated its ability to improve health and reduce medical costs. This intervention demonstrates the relationship between CDC-funded research and the translation of this research into public health programs. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

BIRTH DEFECTS, DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, DISABILITY AND HEALTH Goal 2, Performance Measure 3: This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process. CDC employs a Universal Data Collection (UDC) system to monitor blood safety through blood sample testing of individuals seen at a network of Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) across the country. Blood samples are tested for HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C and other emerging infectious agents as needed. These samples provide a national repository for the testing of emerging infectious diseases to quickly identify blood-borne infections contaminating blood products used to treat bleeding disorders and prevent transmission of infectious diseases. Given that the hemophilia population utilizes more blood products than any other group, the UDC acts as an early warning network for the identification and prevention of transmission of blood borne agents. The UDC also provides information on joint mobility and function, bleeding occurrences, treatment and vaccinations. Goal 2, Performance Measure 4: This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process. Development plays a critical role in the biological and behavioral processes that impact health and well-being throughout the lifespan, but has increased importance for immediate and long-term health outcomes during infancy, early childhood, and adolescence. Healthy children are more ready to learn and are more likely to become healthy adults who will be productive members of society. Children who grow up in environments where their developmental needs are not met are at an increased risk for compromised health and safety and learning and developmental delays. In addition, it has been demonstrated that adults who were exposed to four or more adverse childhood events were at higher risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, suicide attempt, smoking, poor self-rated health, multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted disease, physical inactivity, and obesity. In response, CDC focused on developing an innovative public health intervention to promote protective factors and ameliorate risk factors impacting developmental outcomes. This intervention is currently being tested by a multi-site randomized control trial. Goal 2, Performance Measure 5: This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process. CDC's activities to support early hearing detection are important for ensuring timely referral to early intervention for all infants with hearing loss. CDC supports state-based efforts to promote and ensure that all children receive a hearing screening before one month of age. This includes infants born in hospitals as well as those born in community birthing centers, homes, and other settings. There is a two year data reporting lag. Goal 2, Performance Measure 6: This measure was developed through the 2006 PART process. In order to achieve this goal, CDC is engaged in the development of a population-based monitoring system designed to ascertain key health information for people with Muscular Dystrophy. This system, MD STARnet, is the only source of epidemiologic data necessary to engage in intervention research. Annual goals are set to document progress towards the health outcome. These benchmarks reflect essential steps in the public health process: public health surveillance, epidemiologic research, and intervention development and delivery.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICE
HEALTH STATISTICS

a) Reduce data release time lags.

Because the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is conducted throughout the year, yielding a nationally representative sample each week, data can be analyzed weekly or quarterly to monitor health insurance coverage trends and other selected estimates. In FY 2006, CDC's NHIS continues to provide the most recent health insurance coverage data, as well as quarterly trend data on selected topics, such as data on usual place to go for medical care, and the prevalence of smoking for adults. Trend data for 2005 were released in June 2006. The microdata release for 2005 occurred one month earlier than last year's release. Trend data for the first half of 2006 (January to June) was released in December 2006.
CDC substituted the Early Release of Selected Estimates from the NHIS as CDC's example for this efficiency measure because it is a more accurate measure of CDC's efforts to improve timeliness, as it represents work done by CDC (rather than work done, in part, by partners outside of CDC's control).

b) Make statistics Internet accessible.
In FY 2006, CDC continues to achieve improvements in technological advances, such as the use of the Internet to make data more timely and accessible. Virtually all CDC publications are available on the Internet concurrent with their release in published form.
All CDC data are now available, from 1968 to the present, on CD-ROM. CDC also recently made its Web site accessible to visually impaired data users. Other efforts are being made to increase the accessibility and usability of the data systems and website for disabled people.

Internet-only releases, such as Health E-Stats and the Early Release of NHIS (data for the first half of 2006 were released in December 2006) help make CDC's data more accessible to the public. Health, United States, 2006 was
released on line in November and will be mailed to data users in January.

c) Produce publications.
In FY 2006, CDC continued to lead the efforts to produce America's Children in Brief which was released in July 2006. America's Children in Brief, Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2006, released in July 2006. This year the report is a condensed version that highlights selected indicators. The more detailed report will be published in July 2007.

Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will be replaced by the efficiency measure below.

Efficiency measure 2 has been developed through the PART process for the 2005 cycle and is also serving as a
long-term outcome measure. Through this measure, CDC will track improvement in the timeliness of data provided to the nation's health decision makers. The measure will address Health Statistics data in the aggregate; the unit of
measurement is months.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:
a) Conduct ongoing surveys.
In FY 2006, all four targeted data systems were operating and producing detailed trend data for monitoring health. For example, one system, NHANES, identified 6,400 individuals, interviewed 5,100 and examined 5,000 individuals in 15 scientifically-selected communities across the nation to generate national estimates. The National Nursing Home Survey, a component of the National Health Care Survey conducted in 2004, surveyed long term care providers for the first time since 1999. The public-use data files were released in August 2006.
b) Increase participant response rates.
In FY 2006, NHANES achieved a 78 percent response rate through outreach with communities, constituents, states, and policy makers. CDC expects NHANES response rates will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the sample design and current conditions, and that the cumulative response rate over six years of the survey will be maintained between 77 to 78 percent.
c) Work with partners.
In FY 2006, CDC continued to work with the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, individual states, and other agencies including the Social Security Administration to advance the reengineering of the nation's vital statistics system. This ongoing project reached several key milestones with the development of technical specifications for electronic systems that can be followed by states and their vendors in the development of systems. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.
Goal 1, Performance Measures 2 ­ 4:
These new measures have been developed through the PART process for the 2005 cycle and will replace the previous GPRA measure when it is retired.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
This measure addresses the performance element of quality and scope. CDC will implement a systematic approach and tool for assessing the satisfaction of key data users and policy makers (e.g., reimbursable collaborators, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, OMB, Congressional Research Service and others) relative to data quality and scope. The Health Statistics Board of Scientific Counselors is being used to help identify the list of key data users and policy makers to be surveyed, along with those organizations that directly work with CDC through interagency agreements. Performance results will be used by CDC managers to drive program improvements.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICE
HEALTH STATISTICS

This measure addresses the performance element of scope. Health, United States, the most comprehensive publication produced by CDC, draws information from each data system, as well as data from other federal partners and collaborators. Improvements in the scope and detail of Health, United States are a proxy for the scope of data produced and made available by CDC. Improvement and innovation in Health, United States can be assessed through four components: 1) new charts in the Chartbook; 2) new trend tables; 3) tables substantially revised; and 4) major methodological changes. The published archived volumes can be inspected yearly and compared to their predecessors to measure the continuous improvement and innovation.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 4:

A primary objective of CDC is to maximize the use of data collected through investment of public funds. As the use of data increases, so does the return on investment. One way to increase use is to make data available in more easily accessible forms. CDC makes its data available in a variety of forms through the Internet and works to improve the speed and efficiency with which people access the data by: a) development of data input statements/programs that allow people quick access to our data files; b) development of masked variance files that allow researchers to more quickly access data; c) development of Fast Stats and Quick Stats to quickly access data files; and d) use of Beyond 20/20 software making it more likely that systems like the CDC Data Warehouse on Trends in Health and Aging, Asthma, Healthy People 2010, and Healthy Women: State Trends in Health and Mortality, will be found and used, thereby increasing the use of data already collected.

During 2006, the following improvements have been made on the CDC website:

· NHANES Online Tutorial provides all pertinent information researchers and policy makers need to know about analyzing current NHANES data on a web-based product. The tutorial is designed to help users navigate through the dataset and browse through different modules to gain insight into NHANES data.

· VitalStats site contains a collection of vital statistics products including pre-built tables as well as the ability for users to create tables, charts, grafts and maps based on over 100 variables. The reports allow users access to vital statistics and population data interactively.

· NCHS Survey Measures Catalog: Child and Adolescent Mental Health, provides users with an overview of the measures of child and adolescent mental health and use of mental health services in various surveys of NCHS data systems.

· The Email Subscription service provides a quick, easy way for users to request notification of changes to web pages.

· Provisional Release of NHIS is an accelerated web-based release of NHIS survey data which provides researchers and policy makers quicker access to survey data.

Efficiency Measure 1:
The most important tool for frontline practitioners is current, "just-in-time" information and knowledge. Public health and healthcare information must be continuously updated, translated, and communicated to meet changing conditions and threats. Further, information must be available in the form most useful and accessible to health professionals. To meet these needs, CDC is maintaining systems for information and knowledge transfer, and ensuring that scientific and medical information is translated and communicated effectively and that the best practices of public health professionals are shared nationwide. Due to the creation of the National Center for Health Marketing in 2004, this measure has been revised to reflect that multiple communication channels are aligned beyond distance learning alone.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
The Public Health Image Library (PHIL) is a unique online gallery of scientific photographs, electronic images, videos, and other digital images representing significant public health visual information. Each image includes text meta-tags describing the images that allow for searches by users who are seeking specific images for educational purposes. Clinicians, scientists, researchers, publicists, teachers, students, and the public can access PHIL and obtain images depicting everything from microorganisms to mosquitoes, rashes to risk factors. High resolution formats of the images online allow users to download and use images directly in print or electronic materials. In FY 2004, 6,150 images were digitized, referenced and archived in PHIL. The target of expanding PHIL by 3,000 images for FY 2004 was unmet. The target was not met due to an error in recording the original measure in 2004. In FY 2004, the program developed and measured a GPRA target for PHIL, estimating that the number of PHIL images would total 5,500 by the end of 2004 and 6,500 by the end of FY 2005. These measures were met and exceeded. At the end of FY 2005, the PHIL currently stands at 7,300 images. The target of designing customizable functionality for the Local Health website for FY 2005 was unmet. The PHIL has been modified to include specific audience oriented portals and interface for local public health professionals. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Improving the usage of CDC's online public health emergency alert systems, training materials, and other electronic
resources/tools will have immediate and lasting impact on our ability to protect citizens from natural hazards and terrorist threats. For example, CDC's Epi-X emergency alert system for public health officials nationwide could be
expanded to alert other key sectors including government officials, medical officers for businesses, and health care leaders about health emergencies. CDC's online learning tools to train first responders and public health officials
involved in preparing for and responding to national emergencies improves our ability to protect the U. S. This will be
particularly critical in preparing for a pandemic that may isolate individuals from social gatherings, work, medical
facilities, etc. CDC will establish a FY 2006 baseline by March 2007.

The scientific information produced by CDC is only as effective as its translation for and delivery to the many health care, partner and public audiences with which the agency interacts. Satellite distance learning broadcasts for health care professionals have been produced by CDC for many years. In addition, television can be used more broadly with broadcasts to reach the public as well as partners. With the proliferation of new technologies that allow delivery of information to very specific audiences, CDC can now access and use a broad array of multi-media channels to quickly translate science into usable information accessible in many formats (e.g., public cable television, web casts, voice pod casts, etc).

Efficiency Measure 1:
Environmental Health's Advisory Committee merged with ATSDR's BSC in December 2004. This consolidation decreased the total number of board members and has resulted in a cost savings for FY 2005 and FY 2006. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will be replaced with the new efficiency measure developed through PART listed above.
Efficiency Measure 2:
Environmental Health has taken a number of steps to become more efficient and productive, including reducing the size of the Office of the Director (OD) by decreasing the number of the office's program-support FTEs per million dollars. Further steps are being taken throughout the organization, including the following:
· CDC has achieved efficiencies in measuring environmental chemicals or their metabolites in human samples by developing new analytical biomonitoring methods and improving existing ones, making them faster, more accurate, easier to perform, and less costly.
· CDC has reduced costs and improved efficiency by making the vast majority of its materials available on the Internet. In addition to reducing printing and postal costs, electronic distribution greatly reduces the time required to deliver important information.

1 The target for FY 2007 was adjusted to reflect the effect of the FY 2007 Continuing Resolution for planning purposes.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:

Currently, CDC can measure at least 300 chemicals or their metabolites in human blood or urine. However, not all of these are yet measured in specimens obtained from participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In FY 2006, the laboratory measured levels of some 274 chemicals in people who participated in NHANES and through multiple studies that the lab participates in across the nation and throughout the world. CDC will publicly release exposure data on these chemicals in July 2007 by publishing CDC's Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals. Although this document is currently published every two years, the complex analyses reported in the document are conducted year-round. FY 2007 and 2008 targets have been increased in light of scientific advancements which enabled increased assessment capabilities.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:

The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program funded 21 states and three local health departments (33 grants) for capacity building, and data and infrastructure enhancement activities. Of these, 12 states and one local health department (17 grants) were funded specifically to conduct data-linkage demonstration projects. In FY 2006, the program supported completion of 30 environmental public health tracking assessments examining the possible association between a health effect and an environmental exposure and/or hazard. Tracking led to 17 public health actions. For example, the Massachusetts Tracking Program found a statistically significant association between the presence of moisture problems in a school and pediatric asthma prevalence, indicating a need for public health

follow-up or intervention, and provided information for policy changes aimed at reducing mold and moisture in schools. The Tracking Program is working with school officials to identify how to remediate the moisture problems. Such efforts are helping to lay the groundwork for a National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network.

Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 3:

Thirty-four studies were completed in FY 2006, which focused on the health effects of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, water contaminants such as algal toxins, chemicals, and radiation. These studies focused on the health effects of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, water contaminants such as algal toxins, chemicals, and radiation. Many of these studies were responses to specific state requests, a number of which were related to extreme weather emergencies. Targets were reduced for FY 2008 in light of proposed funding levels for all NCEH programs that contributed to this measure.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 4:

This new measure, developed though the 2005 PART process, will ensure the quality of several different tests in a large number of laboratories that participate voluntarily in these quality assurance and standardization programs. Although CDC makes every effort to encourage participation in these programs, it cannot compel laboratories to participate. The target for FY 2006 was not met because the standardization programs are entirely voluntary, and the number of labs that participate fluctuates due to multiple factors, including CDC laboratory requirements and import restrictions.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
CDC aims to reduce hospitalizations due to asthma by helping state coalitions create and implement comprehensive asthma-control plans that include science-based interventions, partnerships, and asthma tracking systems. The asthma surveillance data is used to identify and provide interventions to people most in need, thereby preventing hospitalizations and other adverse health effects of asthma. This effort is being measured by direct target goals set by Healthy People 2010 and is driven by HHS's strategic goal to "reduce the major threats to the health and well- being of all Americans."
CDC funded 34 state/city/territory grantees in FY 2006 to develop or implement comprehensive asthma control plans. Part B grantees (Michigan, New York, Oregon, California, Illinois, and Minnesota) are funded to implement their asthma control plans fully. This measure is based on the HP 2010 goal of reducing hospitalizations for asthma (goal 24.2). Part A-enhanced (partial implementation) and B states represent 59 percent of the U.S. population.
The reporting dates for this measure have been revised to more correctly reflect the data lag. Issues regarding the quantity, quality, and non-standardized collection of asthma data in states will affect the program's ability to report on this measure. As of December 2006, CDC obtained partial data for 2003. For five of the six Part B states, the ageadjusted hospitalization rate for 2003 is 148. The baseline for Part B states is 146.95; therefore, the partial results for 2003 are not significantly different enough from the actual to make any determination about whether hospitalizations are trending up, down, or level. CDC would like to retire or modify this measure in FY 2009 and replace it with another that is more timely, measurable, and reflective of the program's focus and resources.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 2:
CDC's Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals quantified the effectiveness of national, state and local efforts to reduce blood lead levels (BLLs) in young children (aged one to five years). The percentage of young children with elevated BLLs--10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dl) or higher--has decreased from an estimated 4.4 percent in NHANES III (1991­1994) to 1.2 percent for 2003­2004. This decline indicates that lead exposure among young children in the general population is diminishing.
The 2004 NHANES estimates that approximately 240,000 children (1.2 percent) aged one to six years had elevated BLLs, indicating approximately a 50 percent decline in the percentage of children with elevated BLLs. This figure should be interpreted cautiously, however, because the NHANES estimates are based on small numbers of children with BLLs  10µg/dL, and there is limited experience comparing estimates intervals containing only two years of data instead of the four years preferred by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 3:
The International Emergency and Refugee Health (IERH) program coordinates CDC's response to complex humanitarian emergencies, such as technical assistance to other federal agencies, the United Nations (U.N.), and organizations in areas related to the health of refugee populations. CDC provides interventions to ensure disease outbreaks are prevented from spreading among refugees and displaced persons in complex humanitarian emergencies. For example, CDC provided technical assistance and statistical support for the analysis of data from the joint nutrition and food security assessment in Darfur; conducted a nutrition and micronutrient survey and assessed U.S.-supported primary health care programs in Burmese refugee camps in Thailand; assisted UNICEF in the design and implementation of a measles immunization campaign in south Sudan, whereby an estimated 500,000 children were vaccinated; and supported U.S. government response efforts following the earthquake in Pakistan. The target for FY 2006 was decreased to 90 percent (from the FY 2005 target of 100 percent), due to limitations on staff and other resources. In some cases, providing assistance may also be against U.S. foreign policy or be otherwise inappropriate. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) underwent the Program Rating Assessment Tool (PART) process in FY 2006 for the FY 2008 budget submission. As a result of new PART goals and measures, several of the performance budget measures have been changed or retired, and new measures have been added.

Efficiency Measure
1. Through the implementation of web-based systems for state and territorial agencies, decrease the time between the submission of an application and the receipt of funds for injury prevention and control efforts. [E]
2. Reduce the amount of time to submit funding packages for non-research funding opportunities to CDC's Procurement and Grants Office. [E]

Cross Reference: Measure 1 - HHS-8, *-3, 4. Measure 2 - HHS-8, PART

Efficiency Measure 1:

With an initial investment to develop the system, efficiencies are created when applications are received and processed more quickly. A web-based system also allows grantee information to be retrieved faster and more accurately than what can be collected otherwise. In addition to the time saved, this measure also improves customer service. As more applications become standardized and grantees become more familiar with their format, the grant application process will require less time and provide for more efficient means of tracking and monitoring the status of submissions. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

In FY 2005, NCIPC began the implementation process to track the new PGO baseline measures established in FY 2004. In FY 2006, the number of days decreased by 36 from FY 2005. NCIPC continues to make improvements to streamlining the process through establishing timelines and working with program personnel.
Efficiency Measure 2:
This efficiency measure will track the Injury Center's efforts to meet one of CDC's overarching Key Performance Indicators. The funding package cycle time is defined as the time from the conclusion of the review panel until the funding package is sent to CDC's Procurement and Grants Office (PGO). During this time frame, NCIPC is required to summarize the reviews (primary and secondary) of each application for a particular funding opportunity and develop a funding package document to submit to PGO. PGO's target for this time frame is seven days. In FY 2006, NCIPC took an average of 52 days to submit the funding package to PGO. NCIPC will use its NEXT system to verify its performance for this measure.
CDC's Injury Prevention program was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget for the FY 2006 PART process. This process helped CDC redirect and refine its performance measures for injury prevention and control. Based on its PART review, CDC has revised its goals for injury prevention. CDC will track the following goals and measures (Goals 4 and 5) and will no longer report on Goals 1 through 3, after reporting for their FY 2006 targets is complete.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:

CDC is developing a measure to track its performance in the rape prevention and education program. A baseline of 3,328,735 school and college-aged people reached through programs supported by the Rape Prevention and Education Program has been established by collecting data from grantees through the Rape Prevention and Education Grants System. The language of this measure was modified to clarify its meaning. This measure will be retired after data have been reported for FY 2006.

The number of students reached in FY 2005 was 3,195,563; therefore, the target of a three percent increase for FY 2005 was not met. FY 2005 was the first year NCIPC implemented the process to track increases in the number of school and college-aged people through educational programs, and targets were based on best estimates of achievable results. NCIPC will continue to strive to streamline its efforts to develop strategies that are effective in educating the target population.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:

Residential fire deaths, among states receiving funding for residential fire prevention activities, were 1.17 per 100,000 people, which exceeds the target for FY 2003. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

b) National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) ­ NEISS, funded by CDC in collaboration with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), provides injury data from inner city, urban, suburban, and rural children's hospitals. CDC uses NEISS data to generate national estimates of nonfatal injuries in the U.S. and to guide decisions and policies about injury prevention and control. National statistics on nonfatal injuries treated in emergency departments can be accessed via the internet at http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars/default.htm, meeting the target that was established for FY 2005.
c) National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) ­ In FY 2005, CDC funded 17 states to implement NVDRS, gathering and sharing state-level data about violent deaths. This state-based system collects data from medical examiners, coroners, police, crime labs, and death certificates to understand the circumstances surrounding violent deaths. This information can be used to develop, inform, and evaluate violence prevention programs. CDC met the target established for both FY 2005 and FY 2006.
Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Goal 3, Performance Measure 1:
CDC research focuses on reducing morbidity, disability, death, and lowering costs associated with injuries. CDC's extramural research program supports the following:
· Research centers for broad-based injury control.
· Centers for youth violence prevention.
· Individual, investigator-initiated research that is targeted to specific studies.
· Grants for small business innovative research.
CDC also conducts evaluation research to ascertain the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions and other factors that put people at risk for injury. The extramural program supports a productive and relevant research portfolio and uses a peer review approach that is based on review by the Injury Research Grant Review Committee (IRGRC). IRGRC is composed of experts in injury-related scientific disciplines or current research areas that enable them to evaluate the scientific and technical merits of grant applications. CDC achieved this measure in FY 2006. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
This measure is monitored utilizing data from persons aged 15-24 years among states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System in 2003. This measure contributes to CDC's long term PART goal to reduce homicide rates among youth aged 15-24 by 10 percent in NVDRS states with FY 2003 baseline data.
Youth homicide is the second leading cause of death for youth ages 15-24 years in the United States. and the fourth leading cause of death for children ages 1-14 years.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 2:
This measure contributes to CDC's long-term PART goal to impact self-reported victimization of youth as measured by reductions in two of three of the following: unwanted sexual intercourse, dating violence, and physical fighting.
NCIPC funds numerous programs and activities to address the victimization of youth. This annual performance measure consists of three aspects of victimization of youth ­ unwanted sexual intercourse, dating violence, and physical fighting. The data source of youth victimization is CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). In the YRBS, students enrolled in grades nine to twelve are asked these questions:
· During the past 12 months, did your boyfriend or girlfriend ever hit, slap, or physically hurt you on purpose?
· Have you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to?
· During the past 12 months, how many times were you in a physical fight?

Goal 5, Performance Measure 1:
This measure contributes to CDC's long term PART goal to reduce deaths from residential fires to 1.02 per 100,000 population among the states receiving funding from CDC. This measure reflects more ambitious targets as it includes a greater number of states, compared to the existing GPRA measure which is being retired after data are reported for FY 2006.
In 2004, fire departments responded to more than 410,000 home fires in the United States which claimed the lives of an estimated 3,190 people (not including fire fighters) and injured another 14,175. Almost half of home fire deaths occurred in homes without working smoke detectors. Residential fires accounted for approximately 80 percent of all fire-related injuries and deaths in 2004. Persons at greatest risk of sustaining fire-related injuries are children ages five years and younger and adults ages 65 and older, African Americans, Native Americans, and Alaska Natives, rural dwellers, and persons living in substandard housing or older manufactured homes.
Goal 5, Performance Measure 2:
More than one third of adults ages 65 years and older fall each year. Of those who fall, 20 percent to 30 percent suffer moderate to severe injuries such as hip fractures or head traumas that reduce mobility and independence, and increase the risk of premature death. Falls result in more than 1.8 million adults 65 years and older treated in emergency departments for fall-related injuries, over 421,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 13,000 deaths

INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL annually. Among older adults, falls are the leading cause of injury deaths. In 2000, the direct medical cost totaled $179 million dollars for fatal falls. In FY 2004, NCIPC began the implementation process to track the new older adult falls baseline measures. The target of 39.0 per 100,000 population was based on a best estimation of an achievable result, given trends and existing prevention efforts. The actual result of 39.2 percent did come near the target of 39.0 percent or less. NCIPC continues to streamline efforts to achieve its targets through research and dissemination of effective older adult fall prevention measures. Goal 5, Performance Measure 3: In 2001, the age-adjusted annual fall fatality rate among persons aged 65 years and older was 32.5 per 100,000 population. Based on a review of national data since 1981, NCIPC anticipates that fall fatality rates in this population will continue to rise over the next decade due to continuing decreases in mortality from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, as well as increases in general life expectancy. In addition, the targeted population for this measure is will increase greatly as baby boomers age and enter the age range in large numbers. CDC estimates that the percent increase of fall fatality rates for this population without CDC activity will be 73.8 per 100,000 in 2018. With CDC's activities in this area, NCIPC has targeted an incidence rate of 69.6 per 100,000 in 2018, or a 10 percent decrease in the estimated percent increase of age-adjusted fall fatality rates. FY 2004 was the first year NCIPC implemented the process to track reductions in increases of falls among older adults. NCIPC will continue to strive to streamline its efforts to develop strategies that are effective in getting interventions into the community in order to meet future goals.

Cross Reference: Measure 1 ­ HHS-8, PART; Measure 2 - HHS-8, *-1

Efficiency Measure 1:

CDC partners with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Scientific Review to process grant applications. In keeping with the effort to coordinate resources across HHS, CDC utilizes NIH's peer review and management system and computer program (IMPAC II) for receipt and referral of grant applications. By doing so, CDC streamlines services for the extramural community, ensures uniformity of responses to applicants, and achieves cost efficiencies for the Institute. The two-pronged approach to peer review is highly praised in the scientific community and is considered the "gold standard" for quality peer review. IMPAC II is a real-time system that can be monitored at any stage of the approval process. This review system is based on an eight to nine month timeline. This measure was developed through the 2004 PART process.
Efficiency Measure 2:
Through this measure, CDC will strive to meet the human capital goals of the President's Management Agenda, which calls for a reduction in layers of government, a reduction in the number of managers in each agency, and the ability to provide employee development and succession planning to enhance the work environment and provide future leadership. Progress is already being made towards each of these goals. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Data Validation: Measures 1, 2, and 5 - NIOSH has contracted with the NA to complete reviews of at least two NIOSH sector programs annually. Upon completion of the reviews, the NA submits a formal report to NIOSH, which includes a quantitative rating of the program, summary of findings, refined outcome measures and suggestions for future improvement. Measure 3 - a) Annually, the Office of the Director
develops a report on the number of publications produced by select projects using the NIOSHTIC II database and NPPM system. This report is sent to the Divisions for review, to ensure the accuracy and completion of the information; b) Internal Projects ­ Projects competing for new NORA funds undergo a formal external peer-review process. The NPPM system is used to identify new projects and peer review is verified by the NIOSH Associate Director for Science. External Projects - All external projects are reviewed through the NIH peer review system. The date and details of the reviews are recorded and reviewed by the NIOSH Office of Extramural Programs. Measure 4 ­ a and b) Program analysts in each division as well as the Office of the Director review project plans in the NPPM system to assess the use of tracking information in the development and/or completion of projects; c) NIOSH statisticians check ABLES data quarterly. Annually, the data is compiled and reviewed by the data manager using MS Access for validity of dates, ages, repeated tests on the same individual, and for completeness of data on exposure sources. Independently, a NIOSH project officer uses SAS to compare annual frequency distributions with previous years' data to check for unusual patterns, potential misclassification of exposure sources, and other data problems. The data manager and project officer then reconcile any differences in their annual analyses.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:
CDC has entered into a contract with the National Academies (NA) to conduct a comprehensive review of its occupational safety and health research program portfolio. In FY 2005, the NA Framework Committee established comprehensive evaluation criteria and assembled evaluation panels for the first phase of the review ­ mining and hearing loss prevention. The development of quantitative evaluation criteria was an extensive process, and took longer than expected. Once completed, the NA evaluation panels employed the criteria to conduct the first phase of the review. To provide the NA panels with ample time to conduct the review, the reporting deadline was extended. NA panels have reported on the hearing loss program and will provide a final report and rating on the mining program in early 2007. The respiratory disease and agriculture programs are also currently under review.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
CDC conducts research on the full scope of occupational disease and injury, from basic research on mechanisms and etiology of occupational diseases, to applied research on specific ways to prevent disease and injury in the workplace. The NA panels will provide a final report and rating on the mining program in February 2007. Once the report is received, CDC will report the data and this measure will be retired.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 3:
CDC disseminates its research findings through a variety of publications. In FY 2006, 90 percent of internal research projects and 100 percent of CDC funded research grants and cooperative agreements for occupational safety and health resulted in peer-reviewed publications, meeting the target. Peer-reviewed publications are valuable resources, especially in the dissemination of research findings to occupational safety and health professionals. Alternative publications are also used, such as CDC numbered documents and CDC Alerts, to direct research findings to a broader audience, including employees and employers. This further promotes the translation of research findings into effective prevention practices adopted in the workplace.
In FY 2006, 98 percent of new internal research projects and 100 percent of new research grants and cooperative agreements were externally peer-reviewed at project inception. All new CDC research grants and cooperative agreements are peer-reviewed through the NIH system. CDC exceeded this portion of the FY 2006 target. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 4:
CDC supports several state-based surveillance activities and maintains national databases of occupational injuries and fatalities. Linked to this health information is the identification of exposures to hazards that can lead to illness and injury. With this information, specific research initiatives can be undertaken to understand the relationships between exposures and health outcomes. In turn, intervention strategies are developed and implemented to reduce illness and injury.
In FY 2006, 155 research and intervention projects were based on tracking information, and 15 intervention programs used tracking information to demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs' strategies. CDC continues to reach its performance target.
Although not included in the target, many CDC projects such as training initiatives and information projects are also initiated in response to surveillance information. CDC continuing education courses, CDC Alerts and Fact Sheets may be developed for occupational safety and health professionals, employers and employees to renew concern and present prevention strategies for identified workplace hazards.
To increase tracking capabilities at the state level, CDC collaborated with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to complete a set of occupational health indicators that are designed to provide information about a population's health status with respect to workplace factors. In 2003, the indicators were piloted by 13 states participating in the CDC's States Occupational Surveillance Consortium (SOSC). In 2005, data from the pilot study was published, providing a broad view of occupational safety and health at the state level and differences that exist among states. Currently, all states funded by CDC for occupational health surveillance track these indicators.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 5:
As part of the National Academies (NA) comprehensive review of research activities referenced in performance measure one above, all programs will develop comprehensive outcome-based measures and targets in conjunction with stakeholders and customers. In FY 2006, 52 percent of CDC's programs ­ mining, construction, agriculture and health care ­ completed outcome measures and targets. These measures and targets formed the framework for evaluation of the impact of research by NA, and will establish transparent customer-based targets across the entire portfolio.

Data Validation: Measures 1 and 6 - The survey is conducted by the NIOSH Education and Information Division, in compliance with the
standards of the Data Quality Act. Measure 2 - OEP staff review and verify data with grantees via phone or email contact, as needed. Measure 3 - a) The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) annually visits emergency departments that submit data to NEISS to assess case capture, and review records as they are submitted for completeness and internal consistency. NIOSH receives NEISS data quarterly and reviews the subset of work-related cases that CPSC provides to ensure the cases meet NIOSH definitions of work-relatedness. NIOSH reviews a sample of cases after coding by a contractor to ensure a high level of accuracy for codes that describe source of injury and event/exposure leading to injury; b) NIOSH receives the special CFOI file annually. To avoid duplication of fatalities in the counts, source
documents are matched using the decedent's name and other information. To ensure an accurate count of fatal occupational injuries, the census program requires that for each case, the work relationship (that is, whether a fatality is work related) be substantiated by two or more independent source documents or a source document and a follow-up questionnaire; c) NORMS is based on public-use, multiple cause of death data files obtained annually from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS performs data quality check to remove invalid codes, verify the coding of certain rare causes of death, and ensure age/cause and sex/cause compatibility. To ensure the accuracy of the NORMS results, NIOSH compares the findings to the NCHS control tables. Measure 4 - a) NIOSH conducted a telephone survey of a representative sample of professional firefighters and analyzes proprietary data provided by ISEA for each manufacture of NIOSH-approved CBRN respiratory protective devices to assess distribution in the field. NIOSH has also incorporated questions regarding CBRN SCBA availability in the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program Evaluation Fire Department Survey, administered to 3,000 fire
departments throughout the country in spring 2005; b) In 1997, the partnership between NIOSH and the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) resulted in a voluntary agreement that equipment manufacturers would incorporate effective fume emission controls on all new highway class pavers. Reports for NAPA and assessments of the average service life (10 years) for highway class pavers enable NIOSH to assess the use of pavers equipped with the recommended engineering controls. Measure 5 - a) The MSHA data is collected according to the agency's standard rigorous sampling and handling protocols. The validation of NIOSH data is ensured by following the protocols developed during the generation of the research proposals. The proposals are peer-reviewed and include calibration requirements for the measurement and handling of the dust samples, as well as procedures for analyzing the results and ensuring the meaningfulness of the data

1 CDC delayed the next customer survey until 2006, to better measure the impact of this and other new communication tools.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:

CDC engages in capacity building activities through information dissemination. Previously, CDC assessed its capacity building capabilities through information dissemination by conducting a survey questionnaire of four professional associations. In 2005, CDC and the occupational safety and health community began efforts to redesign NORA, aligning OSH research with eight industrial sectors, to improve the impact of OSH research and information. This redesign necessitated the revision of the CDC-NIOSH Customer Satisfaction survey and the establishment of a new baseline. Pending OMB approval, the revised survey will query more than 1,500 members of various trade

associations and labor unions on the use of NIOSH information services, the utility of the information provided, and OSH information needs. The findings will assist CDC in future efforts to partner and communicate with the OSH community. Due to the necessary redesign of the survey, CDC is unable to report results for FY 2005. Once OMB approval is received, CDC will immediately begin conducting the survey. The findings of this survey will be used to establish a baseline by which progress of the new sector-based approach can be tracked.
One example of a CDC communication tool that has been successfully in disseminating information to the broad OSH community is the "NIOSH eNews". This monthly electronic newsletter is designed to provide stakeholders and researchers with a timely update on what's new in worker safety and health. Currently, more than 25,000 readers subscribe to eNews, enabling them to receive each new issue automatically by e-mail. The electronic format is versatile and interactive allowing readers to access other online resources, as well as provide CDC with comments and feedback on our performance.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 2:
This measure focuses on the effectiveness of CDC training with respect to entry into the field of occupational safety and health. CDC conducts a competitive training grant program aimed at increasing the number of professionals trained to work in the occupational safety and health field. CDC supports a network of Education and Research Centers (ERCs) and Training Project Grants (TPGs) around the country. In FY 2006, 461 professionals graduated from these programs with specialized training in disciplines that include occupational medicine, occupational health nursing, industrial hygiene, occupational safety, and other closely related occupational safety and health fields of study.
CDC estimates that about half of all U.S. occupational safety and health professionals graduate from CDC-supported programs at the masters and doctoral levels. In FY 2006, CDC met its performance goal with 80 percent of the professionals graduating from CDC-funded programs pursuing careers in occupational safety and health.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 3:
CDC translates occupational safety and health surveillance and research findings into technically and economically usable solutions to control workplace hazards and reduce work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.
CDC has a long history of conducting and supporting young worker safety health research and intervention activities, and working with partners to improve young worker safety and health. In 2006, CDC produced previously unavailable data to help guide prevention efforts in the agricultural sector and led a federal interagency working group on childhood agricultural injury prevention. The agriculture sector accounts for more work-related deaths of youth than any other industrial sector. CDC also provided input into the revised child labor regulations that became effective February 14, 2005. Building upon curricula and teaching tools developed by CDC-funded grants and others, CDC is developing a core occupational safety and health curriculum for young workers that engages students and teachers in the exploration of risks to youth in the workplace, their rights and relevant labor laws, common workplace hazards and controls, communication skills, and young workers' role in emergency preparedness and response. In FY 2005, CDC worked with state educational agencies to pilot test this curriculum. CDC is currently revising the curriculum based on this pilot test and will work with partners in FY 2007 to distribute this curriculum to educators. CDC will report on sub-target B of this measure in March 2007, when updated data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
CDC is also actively working to decrease the incidence of silicosis, an irreversible but preventable disease most closely associated with occupational exposure to silica. In partnership with the DOL, CDC has established and promoted recommended exposure limits for silica and implemented the Silicosis Education Campaign. These efforts provide workers and employers in a variety of industries, including construction and mining, with a guide to working safely with the potentially hazardous compound. Although the target for FY 2006 was unmet, silicosis deaths have leveled off since the baseline was developed for this measure in FY 2003. In general, silicosis develops slowly, usually appearing 10 to 30 years after exposure. Therefore fluctuations in the annual number of silicosis deaths often do not reflect improvements made over time.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 4:
CDC has issued Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Air Purifying Respirators (APR) approvals and implemented standards for upgrading traditional firefighter Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) to CBRN protection levels. In addition to developing respirator certification standards and user guidelines, CDC is committed to ensuring that CBRN-protective respirators are available to professional firefighters. Based on a CDC/NIOSH telephone survey of professional firefighters and International Safety Equipment Association data, CDC has increased availability of CBRN-approved respirators to professional firefighters to 46 percent - exceeding the FY 2005 ­ FY 2007 targets. This increase is due to CDC certification of additional commercial respirators, the approval of seven additional CBRN Air Purifying Respirator models and more accurate reporting. Part A of this measure will be

PERFORMANCE DETAIL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH retired, as targets for FY 2005 ­ FY 2007 have been exceeded; however information on the availability of CBRN respirators will continue to be reported in Goal 2, Performance Measure 5c. More than 350,000 U.S. workers are exposed to fumes generated during the manufacture or use of asphalt. Asphalt fumes are known to cause irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, and research is underway to determine if the fumes are occupational carcinogens. CDC's goal is to facilitate the installation of engineering controls on virtually all U.S. highway-class pavers. This measure will be retired after data are reported for FY 2006. Goal 2, Performance Measure 5: For most program activities, reductions in occupational illnesses and injuries are due to multiple factors of which research is one component. However for some sectors and activities, extenuating circumstances are minimal and efforts are at a stage where future decreases in illness and injuries logically can be attributed to the success of programs without requiring the additional level of analysis. This measure targets three such high risk sectors and activities which represent impact in (a) occupational illness (due to coal dust overexposure), (b) occupational injuries (in roadway construction), and (c) preparedness (firefighter access to CBRN respirators). Goal 2, Performance Measure 6: The impact of training can be evaluated as a product of two metrics: the number of trained professionals in occupational safety and health positions, and the value of these trainees to their organizations. In addition, a third metric is used to judge the success of training programs based on the satisfaction of trainees. New surveys will be conducted to augment existing data on the impact of training programs. Follow-up surveys with trainees will determine their level of satisfaction with their education, and surveys of companies hiring trainees will judge the impact they are having in the workplace. In addition, efforts will continue to track the number of professionals with occupational safety and health duties that have academic or continuing education training.

GLOBAL AIDS PROGRAM
In 2005, OMB conducted a PART review of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (known as the Emergency Plan, or PEPFAR). The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), Department of State, coordinated the review, which included activities by OGAC, the CDC Global AIDS Program (CDC/GAP), HRSA, NIH, USAID, Peace Corps, and the Departments of Defense, State, Labor, and Commerce. OMB conducted separate PART reviews of the focus country programs, other bilateral programs, and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) activities. As a result of this review, beginning in the FY 2007 budget cycle, GAP has included performance measures for focus country programs and other bilateral programs that reflect GAP's efforts for the Emergency Plan.

GAP currently has offices in 29 countries (including the 15 focus countries) as part of coordinated interagency USG teams implementing the Emergency Plan. GAP supports more than 25 additional countries through its headquarters and regional offices. GAP assists with HIV prevention, care and treatment; laboratory capacity building; surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; and public health evaluation research through partnerships with host governments, ministries of health, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector to help implement the Emergency Plan, including supporting the Global Fund. GAP is uniquely positioned to coordinate with CDC's other global health programs, such as global disease detection, public health training, and prevention and control of other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, as well as with CDC's domestic HIV/AIDS prevention programs in the United States.

As a part of the comprehensive USG Global HIV/AIDS strategy, through the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), GAP has worked closely with partners including USAID and other government agencies, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and others to develop a set of common core indicators of progress. A monitoring and evaluation plan for all activities has been developed and all countries report on their core indicators of progress on an annual basis.

Voluntary Counseling and Testing: In FY 2006, CDC strengthened voluntary counseling and testing (C&T) programs by providing technical assistance to ensure the quality and accuracy of HIV testing, strengthening laboratory diagnostic capabilities, identifying methods to target groups at high risk, and enhancing linkages between C&T and health and social services.
Locally Appropriate Technical Assistance for Treatment of STDs, TB, and Other Opportunistic Infections: In FY 2006, CDC worked to initiate, expand or strengthen locally appropriate technical assistance for treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), TB, and other AIDS-related diseases.
Now that the data for FY 2005 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail. It will be replaced with new measures developed for PART.

PART MEASURES
In 2005, as a result of the PART review, CDC added two new goals and accompanying performance measures to reflect the coordinated activities of GAP under the Emergency Plan. These goals reflect GAP's work in the focus countries (Goal 2) and in other bilateral programs (Goal 3). As a key implementing agency of the Emergency Plan, GAP works closely with other USG agencies and departments in the 15 focus countries to develop one country plan and annual report with indicators for each focus country. The 13 other bilateral countries received more than $5 million total in U.S. Government (USG) funds in 2005 and also report on standard indicators that reflect the efforts of all USG agencies. The new performance measures draw from these indicators and provide information on the number of individuals receiving services; targets are adjusted to reflect the latest information available by the OGAC. Measures included below are reflective of CDC's mission and programmatic activities.

GOAL 2: THE GLOBAL AIDS PROGRAM WILL HELP IMPLEMENT THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF IN 15 FOCUS COUNTRIES BY PARTNERING WITH OTHER USG AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF TREATING 2 MILLION HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE AND CARING FOR 10 MILLION PEOPLE INFECTED WITH OR AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS BY 2008, AND PREVENTING 7 MILLION NEW HIV INFECTIONS BY 2010.

Efficiency Measure:
Developed through the 2005 PART process, this measure demonstrates that most of the Global Immunization Program's funding is used to support mission-critical activities directly through CDC's global partners, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the United Nations Foundation (UNF). Specifically, these funds are used to purchase measles and polio vaccine and/or to provide technical or operational support through these agencies. To continue to meet global goals, CDC needs to maintain this efficiency and support for these activities.

Cross Reference: Measure 1 - HHS-1; Measure 2 - HHS-1, PART

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:

In FY 2005, CDC purchased 428 million doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). Fewer doses were purchased than targeted for FY 2005. This was primarily due to two factors:

· OPV funding in FY 2005 was reduced slightly from FY 2004 funding levels. This was a result of decreased overall funding from FY 2004 to FY 2005 and the availability of funds from other donors for OPV, allowing CDC to use some funding to fill critical operational gaps.

· The cost of OPV increased by 10 ­ 20 percent, from $0.10/dose in FY 2004 to $0.11/dose in FY 2005 and $0.12/dose for monovalent OPV (mOPV). mOPV was reintroduced in FY 2005 and not used in FY 2004.

Goal 4, Performance Measure 2:

Global polio incidence has declined by more than 99 percent from 1988 to 2005. The number of endemic countries has been reduced from 125 polio-endemic countries in 1988 to four countries in early 2006 (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan). Egypt and Niger were removed from the list of endemic countries in January 2006, although Niger continues to have limited transmission following repeated importations of wild poliovirus from Nigeria. The target for number of endemic countries has been increased to three in FY 2007 because India, Nigeria, and likely Afghanistan will not meet the goal of ending polio transmission in 2006 due to multiple program deficiencies or accessibility issues due to conflict. About 250,000 lives have been saved and four million cases of childhood paralysis have been avoided.

In 2005, the American Region of WHO completed its fourteenth year without a reported case of polio due to the wild virus. The Western Pacific Region (includes China, Vietnam, and Cambodia among its 35 countries) and the European Region (51 countries) have achieved regional eradication of polio. However, large, ongoing polio outbreaks in northern Nigeria and western Uttar Pradesh, India are likely to delay polio eradication until 2007. As long as polio transmission occurs anywhere in the world, it remains a threat to American children. CDC will continue to fight against polio by collaborating with partners to increase the number and quality of National Immunization Days and intensify implementation of the other strategies to interrupt transmission. CDC will continue to provide scientific assistance to improve tracking to certify that polio eradication has occurred.

Measure 2 is an adaptation developed as a result of the 2005 PART process and serves as both a long-term and annual measure. The ultimate objective is to eradicate polio. The previous goal tracked cases of polio, whereas the new goal tracks number of countries with endemic polio.

Goal 5, Performance Measure 1:
CDC provided scientific, technical, and programmatic support for measles outbreak investigations in Pakistan, Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Georgia and the Ukraine; supported reviews of immunization surveillance in the African and the Western Pacific regions and a national review in the Republic of the Maldives and the Philippines, helped conduct a review of accelerated measles control activities in the western provinces of China, and evaluated the regional surveillance system for measles, rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in the American and European regions. CDC also contributed funding and or technical assistance to measles immunization campaigns in 23 African countries and to those planned and conducted in Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Fiji Indonesia, Pakistan, Yemen, and others. These efforts resulted in recommendations for improved surveillance and control activities and contributed substantially to declines in measles mortality.
Measles has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere. Measles mortality in the African region has been reduced by 74 percent since 1999, and measles mortality worldwide has been reduced by 60 percent. The target for this goal is based on 2000 data estimating 777,000 deaths; by 2010 CDC aims to reduce the global measles-related mortality by 90 percent compared with this estimate from 2000.
The model used to generate the preceding year coverage is based on routine and campaign related performance data that is captured by a joint WHO/UNICEF reporting form. WHO & UNICEF convene a panel committee to review this data annually and come to consensus on estimates of disease burden.
Goal 5, Performance Measure 2:
This performance measure corresponds with the goal adopted by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). According to available surveillance information, measles transmission has been interrupted in all countries of the Western Hemisphere since November 2002. However, imported measles cases, with limited secondary spread, continue to occur in several countries, including the U.S. Deaths from measles complications in the Americas have virtually disappeared. Globally, measles caused an estimated 345,000 deaths in 2005 and was the leading cause of death among children under five years of age from a vaccine-preventable disease.

During 2006, it was determined that there would be no specific Senior Policy Workgroup meeting, rather CDC and IHS senior staff would collaborate on important issues on a regular basis to maximize resources and services going to AI/AN tribes. The agencies continued to have multiple teleconferences on issues such as STD/HIV, Diabetes, closing the gap on infant mortality, pandemic influenza planning, and terrorism preparedness and response. In addition, CDC initiated discussions to strengthen IHS-CDC partnerships through the development of an umbrella Interagency Agreement (IAA) with the National Center for Health Marketing and IHS. This IAA will assist multiple CDC Centers, Offices and Divisions to have one agreement that establishes consistent measures and reporting requirements while still allowing flexibility for different programs. CDC is examining the development of a new measure focusing on AI/AN activities. Therefore, the utilization and implementation of this measure will be assessed for future use, pending an FY 2006 assessment and the availability of funding.

They support national and/or regional initiatives to develop, expand, and enhance health promotion, educational, and community-based programs targeting racial and ethnic populations. Once funding was in place, current infrastructures and national networks allowed provided grantees with multiple mechanisms to exceed the anticipated target for Measure 1. They also allowed programs to quickly identify a multitude of program and organizational infrastructure needs relevant to Measure 2. Final results of the FY 2007 performance goal measures for the seven cooperative agreements awarded to support and strengthen existing National and Regional Minority Organizations (NMOs/RMOs) that engage in health advocacy, promotion, education and preventive health care with the intent of improving the health and well-being of racial and ethnic minority populations will be available in October 2007.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL

PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
The 2004 result was revised from 258 to 221 to reflect fellows that were core-funded in FY 2004. The previous result inadvertently included EIS officers funded with non-core funds (e.g., Bioterrorism, Food Safety). Additionally, the 2005 through 2008 targets have been revised to remain constant, due to the creation of the Office of Workforce and Career Development in 2004 and uncertainty about funding limiting programmatic ability to increase the number of health professionals recruited and/or trained.

GOAL 2: INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FRONTLINE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL THAT ARE COMPETENT AND PREPARED TO RESPOND TO BIOTERRORISM, INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS,
AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS AND EMERGENCIES; AND PREPARE FRONTLINE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND LABORATORIES TO RESPOND TO CURRENT AND EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH

Cross Reference: HHS-2, 4, 5, HP-23

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
The National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN) conducted 255 training courses and trained more than 27,000 participants through cost-effective, high quality continuing education in the laboratory sciences during the FY 2006. NLTN courses are available in a variety of formats, developed based on documented training needs, and delivered in collaboration with state public health laboratories. Course topics include bioterrorism and chemical terrorism preparedness, safe packaging and shipping of diagnostic and infectious agents, biosafety and biosecurity, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pandemic influenza preparedness. Selected courses from the previous year are evaluated to determine outcomes of training.
The FY 2006 target related to safety and security in the laboratory were met at 90 percent. Between January and April 2006, 324 participants from 13 states attended NLTN courses in laboratory biosecurity practices, which included information on physical security access control, information security, and training/practice drills. Additionally, a comparison of pre and post test scores showed that 226 (73.6 percent) of course participants improved their knowledge of biosecurity practices. Six months following the training, 9 (2.7 percent) of participants reported writing a biosecurity plan for their laboratory for the first time. Thirty-nine (12 percent) of course participants reported implementing positive changes in their facility in at least one of the biosecurity practice areas listed above.
This training and gathering of statistical data will continue during FY 2007.

Efficiency Measure 1:
A non-web-based Grants Application and Reporting System (GARS) is burdensome and inefficient for states and CDC. This burden is exacerbated as states face deep budget cuts. State health departments will save 1,952 hours per year on project reporting by using a Web-based GARS (1,952 grantee hours equals an average of four system per grantee times 61 grantees times eight hours per installation). CDC will save 720 hours, for a total saving of 2,672 hours.
The FY 2007 President's Budget proposed elimination of the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. Therefore, CDC implemented only thirty percent of the highest-priority components of the system by December 2005. Given the inclusion of the PHHS Block Grant in FY 2006 budget and the indication that the program will be continued through a continuing resolution for FY 2007, CDC is proceeding with development and installation of the remaining web-based modules to make GARS fully web-based. The software development is on track at 55 percent completion. A partial implementation is planned for September 2007 and full implementation is scheduled to be completed by December 2007.

BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

In addition to PART measures established in the 2004 review of Buildings and Facilities, CDC has implemented HHSlevel Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) performance metrics. CDC used the following measures and definitions detailed in the memo, HHS Real Property Asset Management Program Performance Measures (DAS/OFMP, 8 SEP 2005), to assess its FY 2008 B&F budget submission described in the attached Program Narrative, as directed in the memo, Pre-Budget Guidance for the HHS Fiscal Year 2008 Budget (DAS/OFMP, 30 MAR 2006).
· Mission Dependency ­ An indication of the value an asset brings to the performance of the HHS/OPDIV mission.

· Facility Utilization ­ A quantitative assessment of the degree to which assets are utilized by asset type, including "Utilization Status," "Utilization Rate," and "Disposition Recommendation."
· Facility Condition ­ A quantitative assessment of how well an asset is being maintained in accordance with a systematic Sustainment and Improvement Strategy.
· Facility Cost ­ An assessment of the total operating and maintenance costs at the asset level, and positive project economics such as cash-flow or life-cycle cost analysis.

FRPC Performance Metrics

Nationwide Repairs and Improvements (R&I) Program

FRPC Measure

Impact

Explanation

Mission Dependency

Mission Dependency

Positive

R&I funds will be used for "mission critical" and "mission dependent" facilities in accordance
with CDC's Sustainment strategy. Repair funds are used to sustain buildings in an "operational status." Improvement funds are used to modify space to bring it into alignment with current codes and reduce "overutilized" space.

Facility Utilization

Utilization Status

Positive

R&I funds will be used for "overutilized" and "utilized" facilities in accordance with CDC's sustainment strategy.

Utilization Rate

Positive

R&I funds are used to restore assets to a condition that allows their continued effective
designated use, and to improve an assets functionality or efficiency, thus maintaining or improving the utilization of the asset.

Retention/Disposal

Positive

CDC intends to use R&I funds to demolish part of 45 identified underutilized, non-mission
critical, underperforming assets between 2006-2010, that are not funded through major (Capital) projects, thereby improving portfolio utilization rates and reducing costs. An additional 13 assets have been identified for disposal by 2013.

Facility Condition

Positive

As shown in the Facility Condition Index table, R&I funding at these levels will support CDC's sustainment strategy to maintain portfolio CI=90 or better.

Sustainment and Improvement Positive Strategy

CDC has a current (2006) estimated Building Maintenance Backlog Reduction (BMAR) of $61 million. At the R&I funding levels detailed in the Facility Condition Index Table, CDC will
reduce BMAR by $11.3M to achieve a minimum portfolio CI=90 by FY 2013.

Facility Cost

O&M Cost

Positive

CDC anticipates a positive but unquantified impact on O&M costs resulting from sustainmentlevel R&I funding. Appropriate R&I and BSS funding will ensure that plant and equipment are operated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer's warranties, and to maximize energy and operating efficiencies.

Project Economics

N/A

Sustainment Strategy Summary: Sustainment funding includes a combination of operations funded maintenance and minor renovations, and B&F funded repair, necessary to sustain the facility in its current condition. CDC funds sustainment through the internal Business and Services Support (BSS) activity (operations) and the nationwide Repairs and Improvements (R&I) Program (B&F).

PERFORMANCE DETAIL BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

Using data from the Automated Real Property Information System data base and individual Building Condition
Assessments, CDC has projected R&I and BSS funding required from FY 2008 to FY 2013 inclusive, to improve and sustain CDC's owned assets at a minimum Condition Index (CI) of 90 as required by HHS. These projections take into
account assets that CDC will propose to HHS for disposal based on the FRPC Disposition Decision Tree, as well as
new assets approved, funded and under design/construction through FY 2006, and proposed assets identified in the
Five-Year Plan with an out-year cost estimate (i.e., B24, B107, B108, and build-out of the Ft. Collins lab shell space). CDC's sustainment strategy incorporates the following measures:

· Base funding requests on periodically updated Facility Condition Assessments for each asset to achieve and maintain a minimum CI=90;

· Prioritize sustainment funding around mission critical assets that are appropriately utilized and can be operated and maintained in a cost effective manner;

· Continue to review the owned and leased inventory to identify assets for disposition in accordance with the FRPC's Disposition Decision Analysis framework (Please note that since the late 1990's, CDC has disposed
of or earmarked for disposal over 40 non-performing assets nationwide); and,

· Continue to request recapitalization funding for new construction or modernization where appropriate to replace non-performing assets as described in the 5-Year Plan in the narrative section.

In response to Executive Order #13123 identifying specific energy reduction goals and applying water management strategies, CDC has initiated monitoring and strategic planning efforts to ensure full compliance with the Executive Order and internal water management standards.
CDC has met 75 percent of its energy goal. CDC is placing considerable emphasis on energy efficient design for its new labs, and this may result in lower future consumption. However, CDC may expect somewhat higher energy usage through the end of the projected construction period [FY 2009] as some older labs remain in service combined with additional electrical usage resulting from actual construction activities.

1 Project approved by the HHS Capital Investment Review Board to proceed with only analyses needed to support project. The project has not been approved for execution and funding beyond the analysis portion. CDC is continuing with the analyses as approved.
Goal 1, Performance Measure 1:

The aggregate scoring of four vital components (scope, schedule, cost and quality) of capital construction will most accurately assess successful performance and use of appropriated funds. The four combined components provide a comprehensive snapshot of capital construction. Scope, schedule, cost and quality are identified and approved consistent with the Facilities Project Approval Agreement process. The scope component will identify the predefined project needs; the schedule component will reflect the critical milestone dates; the cost component will establish the approved project budget; and the quality component will incorporate the scoring reflecting the use of appropriate building standards and codes.

Goal 1, Performance Measure 2:
The movement of CDC laboratorians into CDC standard space will facilitate CDC's ability to meet its scientific mission. CDC standard space includes standards for bio-safety, CDC design, space planning, and accreditation of laboratory animal care and HHS utilization rate policy. This metric has underlying assumptions concerning the stability of CDC's growth rates, workforce composition, laboratory standards, and applicable codes. Any significant changes in baseline assumptions would require appropriate upward/downward adjustments to target rates.

By moving select components of the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) into Building 18, the Emerging Infectious Disease Laboratory, CDC met its goal of 70 percent occupancy by NCID for 2005.

This building houses the Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases (DBMD), the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases (DBMD), the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), HIV and Retrovirology Branch, and the Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH). Building 18 contains unique high containment laboratory space to support research on hazardous pathogens such as Ebola, Avian Flu, and SARS. The facility is also the central receiving, processing and response lab for the CDC Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program and Rapid Response/Advanced Technology Lab.

information system on CDC's Secure Data Network (SDN) for approximately three years. This system, known as SLPP-MIS, is used to receive, process, monitor, and evaluate cooperative agreements of over $750 million per year for 62 grantees. Measure 2 ­ CDC's Coordinating Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response has maintained a management information system on CDC's Secure Data Network (SDN) for approximately three years. This system, known as SLPP-MIS, is used to receive, process, monitor, and evaluate cooperative agreements of over $750 million per year for 62 grantees. Measure 3 - CDC's SNS analysis of product Life Cycle Tools. Measure 4 - COTPER has been at the forefront of development of two information technology tools for budget and performance integration.

Efficiency Measure 1:
In 2006, all 62 newly funded grantees used the system to fully automate their applications, work plans, and semi annual reporting for the CDC Terrorism Preparedness cooperative agreement, resulting in greater program efficiencies. The Marshall Islands territory did not submit an application and was not provided new funding. Currently, all 62 grantees are using the system for self-reporting and reports were received in May and November 2006. The benefits of the system and new supporting processes have improved timeliness of applications, ease of processing and production for review as well as elimination of paper processing. Additionally, development of the system addresses the e-government provisions of the President's Management Agenda. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail. A new efficiency measure has been developed.
Efficiency Measure 2: CDC's DSLR is responsible for providing management oversight and technical assistance for the administration of the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement. As part of the application process, grantees have to submit detailed work plans and budgets which can total 100 pages each. CDC Project Development Officers (PDO) need to review, provide feedback, and approve applications before funds can be awarded. In addition, at the end of the extensive review process, PDOs provide recommendations for each work plan activity and line items are restricted or disallowed for the budget. The issues cited during this review need to be monitored and resolved during the year.
Historically, PDOs conducted technical reviews of the grants using paper-based approaches. This resulted in cumbersome paperwork and difficulty in tracking resolution of issues raised during the review process. To deal with these operational limitations, CDC's Management Information System (MIS) was enhanced to centralize the collection, tracking and management of review information. MIS not only maximizes efficiency of the initial application review, but helps facilitate technical assistance efforts throughout the course of the year. The automation and integration of this process will create overall efficiencies in the grants management process by decreasing the time it takes for PDOs to conduct initial reviews and by providing rapid access to information to track and manage over time.
The efficiency gained from the integration of the review section into the MIS translates into other efficiencies from the grantees' standpoint including:
· Reduces the time that it takes grantees to get feedback regarding their work plans and budgets from Project Officers. This in turn results in a faster implementation of recommended changes thereby improving the overall efficiency of their programmatic operations.
Efficiency Measure 3: This efficiency measure was adopted during the PART process to demonstrate the program's improved efficiencies. The return on investment (ROI) is based on each $1 spent on SLEP costs (e.g., testing, shipping, re-labeling). For FY 2006, the $20 was saved for each $1 spent on SLEP costs, falling short of the goal of $24 saved. This ROI is calculated based on the total estimated replacement costs divided by the total estimated SLEP costs. For the baseline, CDC used 10 FDA SLEP projects submitted in FY 2004.
Efficiency Measure 4:
As systems continue to improve, the goal is to gradually decrease the time and material costs required by contractors while not impacting the quality and timeliness of work developed and delivered.

Targets Under Development

Data Source: CDC's Epi-X network tracks the number of state and local public health professional that use the system. Measure 2 - BioSense application tracks the number of members and users of the application in a database.

Data Validation: The number of state and local public health professionals who use Epi-X to share intelligence regarding outbreaks and other
emerging health events is captured in the Epi-X application. This number is tracked through the registration process of the application. There are automated system controls in place as well as manual procedures that are frequently conducted to validate that the information being collected is accurate. Measure 2 - The number of members and users will be reviewed on a regular basis.

Goal 2, Performance Measure 1:
Epi-X, CDC's secure Web-based communications network for public health officials, links HHS and CDC with state terrorism surveillance and response programs, provides emergency alerts, and creates a forum to share important disease information nationwide. The usefulness of Epi-X has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of users well beyond the original target numbers.
In FY 2006, 4,220 health professionals used Epi­X. The FY 2006 target was exceeded by 1,020 as a result of CDC's vigorous recruitment effort.
Goal 2, Performance Measure 2:

BioSense program officials have determined that, by 2010, all levels of public health with jurisdiction over the top 50 U.S. metropolitan areas will use BioSense for biosurveillance and local health situational awareness as needed by accessing timely (<24 hours old) healthcare data from a statistically representative population. These ambitious steps require continuous program improvement, establishment of new partnerships and data sharing agreements, information technology improvements, and realization of efficiencies. They also reflect the commitment of program resources to the President's national priorities in coordination with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the American Health Information Community (AHIC). The program's FY 2005 baseline and FY 2006 data for this output measure reflect its early and dramatic progress toward this goal.
BioSense acquired real-time clinical care data from over 350 healthcare sources in FY 2006. In additional to realtime sources, BioSense also receives data from 466 Department of Defense and 863 Veteran Administration healthcare facilities. In FY 2006, all data sources cover 27 BioWatch cities and 38 major metropolitan areas.

6. By 2010, CDC's laboratory system will decrease the time from receipt of tissue, food and environmental samples to confirm and report chemical, biological and radiological agents to stakeholders. [O]

Targets Under Development

Data Source: Measures 1, 2, 3 - The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) delivers accurate and timely identification of agents causing public health treats, including both naturally occurring disease and organisms that could be used in a biologic terrorism attack. Measure 4 - In addition to specimen and results data, the Health Level 7 (HL7) message utilized for messaging LRN data to the CDC carries information regarding
the specific data source. This information will allow us to differentiate between LRN Results Messenger and a local LIMS data. Further development is underway to allow easy reporting on various types of messages from the different sources, allowing us to quickly discern the number of messages related to various programs.
Data Validation: Measures 1,2,3 - The data collection and validation activities across the LRN significantly enhances the capacity of laboratories to rapidly detect and identify agents likely to be used in a terrorist attack and provide timely information to health professionals. Measure 4 
Messages sent to the CDC from external sources must pass through the data broker before being parsed and sent to specific programs within the CDC. The Data and Message Brokering (DMB) team will perform edits to ensure that the message is formatted properly and that we have a Collaboration Protocol Agreement (CPA) with the originating entity. The DMB team will also perform some basic edits to ensure that the message contains all required fields and will also perform validation on the vocabulary included in the message to ensure that message utilizes standard vocabulary sets (LOINC, SNOMED, etc.). In addition, we will utilize PHINMS reporting to monitor activity, such as the volume of messages received over a predefined period, from the various partners. Additional validation includes periodic review by BPRP and NCPHI resources to ensure data quality and completeness. And finally, data that is shared with other programs such as BioSense and Biological Warning and Incident Characterization (BWIC) will undergo additional validation specific to that system.

Cross Reference: Measures 1,3,4, 5, 6 - HHS-2, PART, 500-4; Measure 2 - HHS-2, 500-4
1Please note that the nomenclature has changed for chemical laboratories: level-three labs are now referred to as level-one labs and level-one labs are referred to as level-three labs.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 1:
Level-three laboratories, also called sentinel laboratories, rule out the presence of agents and refer samples to reference labs through the use of specified protocols. As a public health preparedness standard, each state should have the capacity to conduct, rule-out and transfer activities. CDC is training all 62 level-three public health chemical laboratories (i.e., chemical terrorism coordinators in these laboratories) in the proper collection and shipment of human samples following a chemical terrorism event. This training also includes four items: an overview of chemical agents; CDC's responsibilities in responding to chemical terrorism events; a discussion of federal regulations on diagnostic packaging procedures and evidentiary-control measures; and hands-on exercises involving the packaging and shipping of human samples. These public health chemical laboratories will then train internal partners (e.g., hospital laboratories, HAZMAT, doctors, office laboratories) in the proper collection and shipment of human samples after a chemical-terrorism event.
In FY 2006, significant progress was made on this measure as 100 percent of states have level-three lab capacity. Fifty percent of the states are within an eight hour driving distance to a level-one chemical laboratory due to CDC's efforts in increasing the number of level-one laboratories from five to ten in FY 2005.
CDC has discouraged the development of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between states for specimen analysis, resulting in a small number of existing agreements. Developing MOUs between states may not be the most efficient use of time. At any given time, a level-one laboratory may be overwhelmed with specimens from their own population or those from another state, necessitating transfer of collected specimens to another level-one laboratory. Using this rationale, a given state would have to develop at least multiple MOUs (one with each level-one laboratory) to ensure their specimens would be analyzed by each facility. Using the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) may be a better vehicle for level-three laboratories to make sure that specimens from their population are analyzed at a level-one laboratory.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 2:
The Rapid Toxic Screen (RTS) is a series of tests to identify various chemical agents in human blood or urine. In a chemical terrorism event, RTS will help determine what chemical agents were used, who has been exposed, and to what extent. In FY 2006, CDC maintained its capacity to analyze 150 toxic substances in the event of a chemical terrorism incident or other chemical emergency. Maintenance includes ensuring proper operation of analytic instrumentation, running particle samples during proficiency testing challenges and response exercises, and providing for a stockpile of supplies and analytic materials that would allow up to 5,000 samples to be analyzed in the case of a chemical event. CDC also is identifying back-up instrumentation that could be used if our primary response instruments are "down" during an event, and is ensuring that staff is cross-trained allowing for back-up analysts if a primary analyst is unavailable during an incident.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 3:
This measure determines the readiness posture of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) for rapid detection of biological threat agents. Since laboratories infrequently encounter biological threat agents, the proficiency testing (PT) program provides familiarity in working with these agents, performing LRN assays using agent-specific testing algorithms, and using available electronic resources to report test results.
The PT program has been in place since the LRN was founded in FY 1999. At its onset, very few LRN member laboratories were able to rapidly and accurately identify biological threat agents and other agents of public health importance. Due to testing challenges and the need for increased training, the FY 2003 baseline passing rate was approximately 75 percent. By the end of FY 2005, the passing rate rose to 83 percent and at the close of FY 2006 the passing rate increased yet again to 87 percent.
A target of 90 percent for FY 2007 and FY 2008 is recommended, an ambitious, realistic, and achievable target. There are several reasons why a 100 percent passing rate is not feasible, including: the priority threat list evolves and thus tests for new agents are introduced to LRN laboratories; and new technologies and equipment become available that require additional training and experience to master new skills. Additionally, the LRN program office at CDC is working to increase the complexity of the PT program to include multiple agents in a single challenge, testing in various non-clinical samples (e.g., food, water, and environmental samples), and requirements to complete a full testing algorithm rather than solely focusing on rapid tests. The combination of new tests, new technologies, and the

PERFORMANCE DETAIL TERRORISM

increasing complexity of the PT program suggests a 100 percent passing rate is unachievable. However, laboratories that fail a proficiency test are required to go through remediation steps that may include consultation, successful completion of a follow-up proficiency test, and/or hands-on training.
Goal 3, Performance Measure 4:

The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Integration Team is dedicated to producing tools to help laboratories enable standard electronic exchange of LRN data using their own laboratory information management systems (LIMS). Achieving the long-term objective for the LRN Results Messenger reflects the need to develop, maintain, and expand information technology solutions for rapid exchange of laboratory results to continuously reduce the amount of time required for critical results to be identified and reported. This requires continuous program improvement, establishment of new partnerships and data sharing agreements, information technology improvements, and realization of efficiencies. Currently, the best marker for network laboratories to indicate their readiness to improve timely reporting for action is their ability to utilize their current LIMS for electronic data exchange to 136 (the current number of member laboratories).
Goal 3, Performance Measure 5:

The time reductions stipulated by this performance measure will directly affect the ability of public health and law enforcement personnel to decrease the time to classify health issues as terrorism or naturally occurring, to decrease the time needed to detect aberrations. Indirectly, these time savings will decrease the time needed to communicate with the public about important health issues, and to identify and provide countermeasures.

Goal 3, Performance Measure 6:

Goal 4, Performance Measure 1:
Epi-X is CDC's secure web-based communications network for public health officials. In FY 2006, CDC increased the availability of Epi-X to 154 states and major metropolitan areas (all 50 states and 87 areas). At the end of FY 2006, 1,461 reports of disease outbreaks and other emerging health events had been posted on Epi­X. As more users participate in exchanging information via Epi-X, reports and use by public health authorities for the reporting of important public health events will increase.
Goal 4, Performance Measure 2:
Currently, all LRN labs can use established protocols for telephone reporting and, in addition, can use an interim spreadsheet mechanism for reporting through the secure website. The LRN was unable to meet its target of 100% for electronic reporting by the end of FY 2006. LRN laboratories faced a variety of challenges associated with the deployment of the software solution, Results Messenger version 2. Several issues delayed individual labs from installing the new software, including limited resources, labs lacking required hardware, and security issues associated with installing new hardware. Also, some labs have opted to forgo the installation of Results Messenger in favor of installing LIMS-compliant systems for reporting laboratory testing results to CDC.

An initial step developed the training to prepare new emergency response field staff for responsibilities in the field. Discipline specific competency-based guidelines have been established. A two-week course basic training curriculum ("boot camp") was developed for all emergency response staff. The training plan and curriculum were coordinated with CDC training goals and were integrated into CDC's Office of Workforce and Career Development. In FY 2006, two course offerings were held in Anniston, AL at the FEMA Noble Trainings Center. Now that the data for FY 2006 have been reported, the measure is retired and will not be reflected in future performance detail. Goal 5, Performance Measure 2: Rebuilding the Quarantine System is necessary to protect the United States from international biological threats, both natural and intentional. Quarantine Station expansion and enhancement will improve the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data related to public health events at U.S. ports of entry. An expanded and enhanced quarantine system includes not only increasing CDC's physical presence at U.S. ports of entry, but also staffing each station with a multidisciplinary team of quarantine medical officers, public health advisors, epidemiologists, and information technicians, enhancing the stations' links to a global network for international traveler disease surveillance, increasing preparedness and response at ports of entry, and expanding collaboration and partnership activities with state and local agencies.

Plans for coming years include continued technical assistance and network testing to ensure timely message translation, dissemination, local response, and feedback. Note that targets b) and d) will be retired after data are reported for FY 2005.
Goal 6, Performance Measure 2:
CDC describes 12 functions of SNS Preparedness required for the effective management and use of deployed SNS materiel. Based on these functions, grantees are required to develop SNS Preparedness Plans detailing the performance of these functions during an emergency. In an effort to enhance grantee SNS preparedness planning efforts, CDC maintains a staff of program service consultants who provide ongoing technical advice and training assistance to grantees. These consultants also assess the grantees' level of preparedness to receive, distribute and dispense SNS assets. This measure is a CDC challenge. Many jurisdictions lack proper facilities to receive the 50 ton package of SNS material. However, CDC provides technical assistance, education and training to improve the ability of states to receive stage, store and distribute the SNS material. In FY 2006, CDC is at 70 percent, not meeting its target of 80 percent.
Goal 6, Performance Measures 3:
As a result of the PART process, CDC developed this long-term performance measure. CDC will grow and maintain treatment/prophylaxis capability for chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear threats. CDC will report on the measure in FY 2008.
Goal 6, Performance Measures 4 - 5:
As a result of the PART process, CDC developed new performance measures. In FY 2006, CDC met its goal of conducting one annual exercise that tested response to multiple events within a 12-hour response time. CDC also met its goal of six trained and ready Technical Advisory Response Unites (TARU) for response to multiple events.

Goal 6, Performance Measure 7:
The time reductions stipulated by this performance measure will directly affect the ability of public health and law enforcement personnel to identify events of national public health importance, initiate investigations, determine causes and risk factors, identify and implement effective countermeasures and provide timely and accurate communications with the public.

Goal 9, Performance Measure 1:
In order for state and local public health agencies to test their capabilities for responding to bioterrorism, chemical exposures, and other public health emergencies, CDC recommends that response plans be tested regularly by staff participation in exercises and simulation drills. Lessons learned from both responses to real events and annual exercises can help identify gaps in preparedness planning and should result in improved public health responses.
In FY 2006, 94 percent (47 of 50) of State health agencies exercised their plans for at least one priority agent. In future years, grantees will need to implement corrective actions within 90 days of identifying a deficiency through a drill, exercise, or real event. The FY 2006 - 2008 targets expect that 100 percent of grantees will meet requirements in these areas. In FY 2006, this measure was not met. However, future exercises, focusing on non-pharmacologic interventions and mass prophylaxis, will be closely monitored to ensure achievement of the 100 percent goal.
Goal 9, Performance Measure 2:
This measure reflects the need to ensure that budget execution matches strategic funding priorities. CDC is developing a decision-support process for linking budget formulation to the priorities identified in the preparedness goal action plan. This decision-support process will allow consideration of new initiatives, expansion or enhancement to existing projects, or the elimination of completed or out-dated projects.
Goal 9, Performance Measure 3:
All individual projects funded to upgrade CDC capacity must improve performance in order to achieve the long-term measures. Individual project performance is monitored continuously and can be summarized as the average timeappropriate achievement of milestones in the core functional areas.
Goal 9, Performance Measure 4:
The spending plan process maximizes efficiency by centralizing the project submission and review process, thereby allowing for the early identification of duplicative efforts. Project submissions include detailed workplans and timelines, and must include responses to standardized evaluation questions that are used to rate and select projects for funding. This process allows for the selection of projects that are most likely to achieve the objectives of upgrading some part of CDC's preparedness capacity, are not duplicative of each other, are well-specified and likely to succeed.

PERFORMANCE DETAIL CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS OVER PREVIOUS YEARS
CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS OVER PREVIOUS YEARS
From FY 2003 to 2008, CDC/ATSDR reduced the total number of measures included in its performance plan by eight percent. The proportion of outcome measures to the total number of measures increased from 44 percent in FY 2003 to 48 percent in FY 2008. The FY 2008 Congressional Justification includes several specific changes from the FY 2007 Congressional Justification.
PART MEASURES
As a result of OMB's 2006 Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process, CDC added performance measures to the FY 2008 annual performance plans, many of which were enhancements upon previous GPRA measures. In 2006, CDC had five programs reviewed through PART, resulting in a total of 43 new performance measures (four efficiency measures, 33 outcome measures and six output measures) were added to CDC's performance plan. CDC's 2006 PART programs include Injury Prevention and Control, Chronic Disease Prevention, Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, BioSurveillance and Upgrading CDC Capacity. To review the new measures, refer to the Detail of Performance Analysis sections.
PREPAREDNESS FRAMEWORK
In FY 2004, CDC developed a new framework to execute the agency's overarching preparedness goals. Following the establishment of this framework, CDC aligned its existing Terrorism performance measures to the appropriate preparedness goals within the new framework. For those goals for which current performance measures do not exist, CDC is leading an effort in coordination with OMB and HHS to develop new outcomeoriented measures. The performance information found in the Detail of Performance Analysis section reflects CDC's new framework for its preparedness goals.
EFFICIENCY MEASURES
Consistent with the PMA Standards for Success for Budget and Performance Integration, CDC "has at least one efficiency measure for all PART'ed programs." To meet this requirement, CDC developed and OMB approved a new efficiency measure for the Immunization, Domestic HIV/AIDS prevention, STD/TB and State and Local Preparedness programs. The Breast & Cervical Cancer and Diabetes' programs had efficiency measures which were approved by OMB as well. However, these measures were subsumed into the new National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion measure developed through PART. CDC had five programs reviewed through PART for the 2006 cycle, resulting in four new efficiency measures added to CDC's performance plan (Biosurveillance and Upgrading CDC Capacity programs have the same efficiency measure).
COORDINATING CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
The Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases has been reorganized into four Centers and Budget Activities: Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention; Zoonotic, VectorBorne, and Enteric Diseases; and Preparedness, Detection and Control of Infectious Diseases. While the goals and measures remain the same, several have been moved based on the new budget structure.

1 FTE levels across CDC are projected to increase due to processing backlogged hiring actions in light of relief from hiring restrictions in FY 2006.

2 The PHHSBG is eliminated in the FY 2008 Budget. As a result, FTE levels for Health Promotion include those from PHHSBG in FY 2008.

3 FTE levels for Terrorism include proposed increases for assigning additional FTEs to Pandemic Influenza Planning and Preparedness which will require hiring scientific and public health personnel in FY 2007 to ensure CDC is able to effectively carry out its role in domestic and global preparedness. Terrorism preparedness activities and the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) program are areas where a stable workforce is essential. Conversion of contractor SNS staff to federal employees to support state and local preparedness efforts is underway. Refer to the "New Positions Requested" exhibit for detailed numbers.

CDC's Full Cost estimates for FY 2006 ­ FY 2008 were estimated by adding program management cost to the budget activities across CDC using the All Purpose Table. Program management costs included CDC's Leadership & Management and Business Services Support activities as well as Buildings & Facilities activities. Program management costs were allocated, where appropriate, across performance program areas based on the proportion of total program level cost represented by each program and performance program area. The full cost of each performance program area was then distributed by performance measures. These distributions are based on professional judgments, supported to the extent possible by financial and other statistical data. In many cases, performance measures are aggregated in the distributions of cost because of the interdependence of the activities and goals represented by the measures. The cost distributions by performance measures are presented for "active" measures in a given year. That is, measures that are to be deleted are included only for the applicable year(s) before their deletion; new measures are included beginning with the first year in which performance data are expected.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
OVERVIEW
Included in this section are CDC's key program management activities to address key aspects of the President's Management Agenda (PMA). The activities below briefly describe CDC's progress in these areas and outline some important initiatives designed to further improve the agency's program management.
CDC has been actively pursuing goals and improvements related to the PMA for several years. For example, CDC decreased its proportion of administrative positions by six percent from 1997 to 2001. CDC has historically focused on keeping the agency market-based and efficient by having approximately 6,000 service contractor staff engaged to conduct commercially-oriented responsibilities. In addition, CDC established its Fiscal Management Excellence Initiative in 2000, which has further enhanced improvements in fiscal performance. CDC is organized to effectively address and lead PMA issues. For example, CDC has established a Management Council to help concentrate management attention on the PMA.
PROGRESS ON PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
CDC made major achievements in addressing the President's Management Agenda (PMA) objectives. CDC has consolidated or restructured nearly 40 major human capital or business services improvements and more than doubled its supervisory ratio, thereby making the agency more efficient and effective. CDC has maintained its reasoned strategic planning approach in Competitive Sourcing for FY 2002 - FY 2005. Another major, successful effort is implementing HHS' Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) which integrates the Department's financial management structure and provides HHS leaders with a more timely and coordinated view of critical financial management information. Furthermore, CDC has made extraordinary progress in Expanded Electronic Government initiatives, such as consolidating IT infrastructure services, having a leadership role in the establishment of a multidepartment architecture for the President's Biosurveillance Initiative, and being actively engaged in HHS' modernization efforts. CDC's efforts to integrate budget and performance have taken on increased significance as the agency continues work to implement a new strategy and organization under the Futures Initiative. Recently, the agency announced modernizations to enhance health impact, support the capacity to respond to public health emergencies, and to directly engage CDC's customers, the American public.
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN CAPITAL INITIATIVE
CDC's significant growth in its workforce over the past years is attributable to an ever-expanding public health mission. From FY 1996 to present, the number of employees has grown from 6,406 to 9,130 - an increase of nearly 43 percent. This trend clearly reflects the agency's expanded disease prevention and control responsibilities. CDC's workforce is comprised of individuals working in over 170 job series with an emphasis on scientific and medical occupations. Approximately two-thirds of CDC employees work in the Atlanta headquarters area. However, the agency has a major presence (defined here as more than 50 employees) in such diverse geographical areas as Cincinnati, OH; Morgantown, WV; Hyattsville, MD; Pittsburgh, PA; Washington, D.C.; Spokane, WA; Durham, NC; and Fort Collins, CO. CDC's overseas presence will be up to 250 employees this year.
WORKFORCE RESTRUCTURING
CDC continues to promote and enhance its Strategic Management of Human Capital initiatives in support of the PMA. These initiatives include reducing layering, eliminating administrative positions through consolidation, further improving our supervisory ratio, and supporting the transition of our workforce toward providing more frontline public health functions.
CDC had already consolidated most of its program support offices to eliminate duplication prior to the PMA. Centralized offices included equal employment opportunity, procurement, human resources, facilities operations, security and emergency preparedness, and others. This consolidation resulted in substantial savings and efficiencies. CDC has undertaken a wide range of additional administrative consolidations and business improvements.
Administrative Consolidations
· CDC more than doubled its supervisory ratio from 1:5.5 in 2002 to over 1:12.6 in 2006. This documents the overall success in flattening organizations, reducing management layers, and consolidating and/or restructuring administrative functions.
· CDC consolidated 13 information technology (IT) infrastructure functions, services, staff and fiscal resources into the new Information Technology Services Office (ITSO). This consolidation reduced operating costs by 30 percent and staff by 29 percent.
FY 2008 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
· A complex and innovative approach to administrative/management consolidation was used to functionally merge the Office of the Director (OD) in both ATSDR and NCEH into one unit. FTE savings of 18 percent (35 FTEs) have already been realized.
· CDC is effectively completing its Business Services Consolidation Plan. This is an overarching strategy, approved by HHS in July 2003, to reduce administrative positions, centralize reporting and supervisory relationships, and establish agency-wide shared services.
· CDC consolidated the agency's medical and professional inquiry hotlines. CDC awarded a performancebased contract for consolidated public and professional health information services reducing over 40 hotlines to one. This will expand services (24x365, multilingual, hearing impaired) and save about $35 million over seven years.
· CDC consolidated graphics services across the agency in FY 2005. This action resulted in fiscal and staff savings, including savings expected from more efficient use of equipment, that can be redirected to mission direct activities.
· CDC completed the evaluation and detailed planning for the consolidation of professional training services. Implementation of consolidated professional training services across the agency is expected to be complete in FY 2006 - 2007. CDC has been working with HHS to implement the HHS Learning Management System.
· CDC completed the evaluation and detailed planning for consolidation of travel services in 2005 with associated fiscal and staff savings for redirection to mission direct activities. In FY 2006, CDC fully implemented e-travel services throughout the agency.
· CDC, with HHS' guidance, completed the restructuring of its human resources office to the HHS Atlanta Human Resources Center (AHRC). This human resources office restructuring eliminated 76 FTEs, reflecting a 30 percent staff reduction. Despite this reduction, the time from AHRC's receipt of a hiring request to the day the job offer is made was reduced by 47 percent between 2003 and 2004.
· CDC consolidated administrative functions in approximately 30 CDC/OD offices, reducing staffing from a baseline of 83 FTEs to 63, or a savings of 24 percent. This action resulted in savings that can be redirected to mission direct activities.
· As a result of these human capital and other CDC business services improvements, the agency has reduced its number of mission support (i.e., administrative) staff by approximately 900 as of the end of 2005. This reduction of mission support staff will allow the redirection of administrative staff positions to front line public health efforts.
Business Process Improvements
CDC successfully implemented a state-of-the-art financial system, UFMS in April 2005. UFMS is part of a multi-year effort initiated by Former Secretary Thompson. CDC went "live" with UFMS' General Ledger and Accounting for Pay System in October 2004. The grants interface (Grants Solution) was also implemented in the first quarter of FY 2005.
CDC is improving procurement and grants operations. Operational improvement opportunities have been identified that will result in increased employee productivity through workforce alignment, process redesign, and operational performance management. This effort has already resulted in new contract cycle time being reduced by 54 percent between FY 2003 and FY 2006.
CDC evaluated vaccine purchase processes and will streamline CDC's purchase of over half of the nation's childhood vaccines through its Vaccine Management Improvement Project.
The Office of Personnel Management approved CDC/ATSDR's plan to offer Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIPs), or buyouts, to staff who worked in mission support functions in FY 2005. Under the VSIP authority, 336 mission support staff separated during FY 2005. CDC's plan was to use the VSIPs to help implement major reorganizations and business services consolidations which resulted in significant business efficiencies and redeployment of positions to front line public heath efforts. In FY 2006, 15 staff separated under VSIP.
CDC has effectively used Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) to reduce mission support staff and restructure efficiencies accordingly. In FY 2003, 73 staff accepted VERA. In FY 2004 and FY 2005, 39 and 93 staff, respectively, retired early under VERA. In FY 2006, 3 staff accepted VERA.
Delayering Actions
CDC has completed delayering the agency to no more than four management layers. In total, CDC abolished over 200 "Sections" in response to this initiative. This "Section" delayering has contributed to a 33 percent decrease in the

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
official number of organizational units at CDC since 2001. This agency-wide approach resulted in compressing the distance between citizens and decision-makers.
FY 2007 ACTIVITIES
· CDC will continue to flatten the agency by further improving its supervisory ratio.
· CDC/ATSDR will continue efforts to redirect more mission support staff to mission direct positions.
· CDC will strategically retrain and redeploy employees impacted by initiatives such as competitive sourcing, consolidations, and reduction of mission support positions.
COMPETITIVE SOURCING INITIATIVE
COMPETITIVE SOURCING PLAN
CDC developed a long range Competitive Sourcing plan to guide the program and the resulting competitions each year. This plan reflects consideration of where and how competitive sourcing can best further CDC's mission, human capital plans and maximize our savings potential. CDC has continually met the plans' goals and maintained "green" PMA scorecard performance ratings.
COMPETITIONS
In FY 2003, CDC completed five studies of its Facilitates Planning and Management Office. CDC prevailed in all five studies, indicating that through rigorous and complex analysis of work, CDC was performing at a cost to the taxpayer less than that of comparable service providers.
In FY 2004, CDC conducted six A-76 competitions involving a range of CDC staff. The specific competitions included: (1) Animal Care, (2) Laboratory, Glassware and Associated Laundry services, (3) Office Automation, (4) Printing (5) Materials Management and (6) Library Services. Again, except for the small printing streamlined study, five of the competitions resulted in in-house decisions. The Library Services performance decision was not announced until FY 2005. This record indicates that through rigorous and complex analysis of commercial work, CDC performs at a cost to the taxpayer less than that of other service providers.
In FY 2005, three new standard competitions were announced for Computer Clerk Support, Statistical Support, and Writer and Editor Services. All three competitions resulted in in-house decisions. These FY 2005 competitions included approximately 150 FTEs. In addition to the standard competitions, the CDC Information Technology Services Office was approved by OMB as a "restructuring" alternative to A-76 competitions. The organization will achieve comparable savings over the next five years. In FY 2006, CDC maximized the opportunity to leverage the new "CDC Now" organizational structure and other reorganizations involving business service functions. This opportunity allows CDC to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of business services within new coordinating centers/coordinating offices. Proposals for High Performing Organizations (HPOs), an alternative to A-76 competition, have been developed and submitted to OMB for the Financial Management Budget Execution Services function and the Public Health Integrated Business Services initiative. These HPO proposals involve over 1,500 commercial FTEs and represent a significant opportunity for CDC to reduce cost in mission support functions and modernize business systems across the agency.
COMPETITIVE SOURCING SAVINGS
CDC savings that accrue from competitive sourcing are reinvested in mission-direct, public health activities. For example, reductions in FTEs associated with mission support functions will be redirected to activities such as epidemiology, laboratory science, medical officials, and pandemic preparedness teams. Information technology savings are used to fund projects that support Health IT, science and other core mission activities such as linking public health and electronic medical records. Similarly, as CDC's mission continually expands with new and re- emerging diseases and health risks, savings are effectively invested in meeting urgent challenges such as avian influenza, tsunami response teams, and hurricane disaster relief efforts. Moreover, new requirements are resulting from opening the new CDC laboratory facilities and Global Communications Center as part of our facilities modernization program. This will help make our health protection tools and information accessible to the global community. CDC is participating in independent audits sponsored by HHS to validate our performance and savings.

IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INITIATIVE
UNITED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (UFMS)
The Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) is being implemented to replace five legacy accounting systems currently used across the Operating Divisions (Agencies). The UFMS will integrate the Department's financial management structure and provide HHS leaders with a more timely and coordinated view of critical financial management information. The system will also facilitate shared services among the Agencies and thereby, help management reduce substantially the cost of providing accounting service throughout HHS. Similarly, UFMS, by generating timely, reliable and consistent financial information, will enable the component agencies and program administrators to make more timely and informed decisions regarding their operations. UFMS has been in production for the CDC and FDA for over a year, with new functionality releases of Grants and IVR in October 2005 and eTravel in April 2006. The PSC implementation was moved to production on October 16, 2006.
The PSC has the responsibility for ongoing Operations and Maintenance (O & M) activities for UFMS. The scope of O & M services includes post deployment support and ongoing business and technical operations services. Postdeployment services include supplemental functional support, training, change management and technical help-desk services. On-going business operation services involve core functional support, training and communications, and help desk services. On-going technical services include the operations and maintenance of the UFMS production and development environments, on-going development support, and backup and disaster recovery services. In accordance with Federal and HHS policy, the UFMS application is under an approval to operate through February 16, 2007 by the designated Certifying Authority and Designated Approving Authority (DAA). The UFMS application will be approved for operation for 1 year after this date. After October 2007, when all OPDIVs will be operational on UFMS, then a 3-year certification will be completed. This approval to operate assures that the necessary security controls have been properly reviewed and tested as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). CDC requests $6,205,562 to support these efforts in FY 2008.
With the implementation of a modern accounting system, HHS has efforts underway to consolidate and implement automated administrative systems that share information electronically with UFMS. These systems will improve the business process flow within the Department, improve Funds Control and provide a state of the art integrated Financial Management System encompassing Finance, Budget, Acquisition, Travel and Property. As the UFMS project is nearing completion, the integration of administrative systems is the next step in making these processes more efficient and effective. CDC requests $511,580 to support these efforts in FY 2008.
With the implementation of UFMS, CDC continues to pursue an aggressive strategy to upgrade fiscal management activities by bridging UFMS to the analytical and reporting tools necessary to respond to complex financial management requirements. These analytical and reporting tools position CDC to respond to current, future and contingency financial management requirements. To accomplish this strategy, CDC planned a multi-phased approach to UFMS. In October 2004, CDC implemented core UFMS Phase I. Core UFMS Phase I Implementation entailed deploying the UFMS General Ledger and Accounting for Pay Systems. In addition, CDC deployed the UFMS Interim Grants Solution in December 2004. This covered more than 50 percent of the dollar and transaction volume of the agency. In April 2005, CDC completed the full UFMS financial and accounting implementation of Phase I which is the cornerstone for future UFMS development and follow-up activities.
Phase II of UFMS started in FY 2005 with continuation into FY 2006 and FY 2007. Phase II will entail multiple tasks to include exploring the possibility of moving CDC to a fully project centric environment, modification of CDC feeder systems to support this environment, and development of a CDC data warehouse that will merge programmatic and financial information for meaningful management reporting. To this end, CDC commissioned and completed a business case to identify timelines, accurate cost estimates, preferred functional and technical solutions and a strategic plan to accomplish these efforts. The business case is currently under consideration. Other activities that will be included in Phase II include piloting the MarkView Invoice Imaging system for UFMS and integrating a number of other departmental business systems with the UFMS core financials. These systems include E Gov Travel, Sunflower property management, IMPAC II for grants processing, iProcure/Prism for acquisitions and Learning Management System for Training. In addition to Phase II development, CDC will also need to plan for Phase I support. This will include continued funding to the HHS UFMS effort, post implementation support, and maintenance and support of non-Oracle systems.
HHS Consolidated Acquisition System
The HHS Consolidated Acquisition System (HCAS) initiative is a Department-wide contract management system that will integrate with the UFMS. The applications within the HCAS are Compusearch PRISM and a portion of the Oracle Compusearch Interface (OCI). PRISM is a federalized contract management system that helps streamline the procurement process. The implementation of PRISM includes the functionality of contract writing, simplified acquisitions, electronic approvals and routing, pre-award tracking, contract monitoring, post award tracking, contract closeout and reporting. Major functions, once integrated with the UFMS, include transfer of iProcurement requisition

The HCAS team is working closely with the UFMS PMO and HHS PMO to ensure a smooth roll out of both PRISM and iProcurement. An integrated team, including personnel from UFMS, Acquisition and Assets has been formed to ensure maximum utilization of in-house expertise. CDC requests $2,401,260 to support these efforts in FY 2008.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT
In FY 2003, CDC successfully began issuing quarterly financial statements and accelerating the closing of accounting records at the end of the fiscal year. The use of automated tools has expedited the financial data consolidation process and streamlined financial statement preparation. CDC continues to prepare timely quarterly statements and implement reviews, checks, reconciliations, and functions analysis to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial statements. CDC is also proceeding with its Financial Management Excellence Initiative to further improve financial operations by following guidelines set by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the U.S. General Accounting Office in their respective November, 2000 reports.
ACCOUNTABILITY CDC participated in the HHS "top down" audit approach in FY 2003 through FY 2006 for which HHS received clean opinions. CDC will participate in the HHS "top-down" audit for FY 2007. Additionally, CDC received five consecutive clean audit opinions from FY 1998 through FY 2002 as evidenced in the independent auditors' report in the CDC/ATSDR Chief Financial Officer's annual reports for the applicable years. CDC also performs management control reviews and risk assessments pursuant to the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act and OMB Circular A 123. CDC reports results to HHS in an annual report.

As part of the Corrective Action Plan, CDC anticipates UFMS-generated financial statements by the end of the first quarter in FY08. CDC is working with UFMS Global and contractors to devise an automated procedure for financial statement preparation.
EXPANDED E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE
CDC's request includes funding to support the PMA's Expanding E-Government and Departmental enterprise information technology initiatives. The CDC will contribute $5,710,805 of its FY 2008 budget to support Department enterprise information technology initiatives as well as the President's Management Agenda (PMA) Expanding EGovernment initiatives. Operating Division contributions are combined to create an Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) Fund that finances both the specific HHS information technology initiatives identified through the HHS Information Technology Capital Planning and Investment Control process and the PMA initiatives. These HHS enterprise initiatives meet cross-functional criteria and are approved by the HHS IT Investment Review Board based on funding availability and business case benefits. Development is collaborative in nature and achieves HHS enterprise-wide goals that produce common technology, promote common standards, and enable data and system interoperability. The HHS Department initiatives also position the Department to have a consolidated approach, ready to join in PMA initiatives.
Of the amount specified above, $1,534,959 is allocated to support the President's Management Agenda Expanding E-Government initiatives for FY 2008. The balance of the EIT fund will be used to support HHS-wide initiatives. The amount supporting the PMA E-Government initiatives as follows:

Prospective benefits from these initiatives are:
Business Gateway: Provides cross-agency access to government information including: forms; compliance assistance resources; and, tools, in a single access point. The site offers businesses various capabilities including: "issues based" search and organized agency links to answer business questions; links to help resources regarding which regulations businesses need to comply with and how to comply; online single access to government forms; and, streamlined submission processes that reduce the regulatory paperwork burdens. HHS' participation in this initiative provides HHS with an effective communication means to provide its regulations, policies, and forms applicable to the business community in a business-facing, single access point.
E-Authentication: Provides standards-based authentication architecture to support Federal E-Government applications and initiatives. It provides a uniform process for establishing electronic identity and eliminates the need for redundant solutions for the verification of identity and electronic signatures. E-Authentication's federated architecture also enables citizens and businesses to use credentials issued by commercial entities, such as financial

institutions, to conduct transactions with the government, eliminating the need for HHS to issue credentials for its systems.
E-Rulemaking: Provides citizens and organizations a single point of access to Federal rulemaking information. HHS posts all rulemaking notices on Regulations.gov. HHS and E-Rulemaking are in the requirements and planning process for migrating HHS docket-management process to the E-Rulemaking system.
E-Travel: The E-Travel Program provides a standard set of travel management services government-wide. These services leverage administrative, financial and information technology best practices. By the end of FY 2006, all but one HHS OPDIV has consolidated services to GovTrip and legacy systems retired. By May 2008, all HHS travel will be conducted through this single system and the last remaining legacy functions will be retired.
Grants.gov: Allows HHS to publish grant funding opportunities and application packages online while allowing the grant community (state, local and tribal governments, education and research organizations, non-profit organization, public housing agencies and individuals) to search for opportunities, download application forms, complete applications locally, and electronically submit applications using common forms, processes and systems. In FY 2006, HHS received over 56,000 electronic applications from the grants community via Grants.gov.
Integrated Acquisition Environment: Eliminated the need for agencies to build and maintain their own agency-specific databases, and enables all agencies to record vendor and contract information and to post procurement opportunities. Allows HHS vendor performance data to be shared across the Federal government.
Lines of Business-Human Resources Management: Provides standardized and interoperable HR solutions utilizing common core functionality to support the strategic management of Human Capital. HHS has been selected as a Center of Excellence and will be leveraging its HR investments to provide services to other Federal agencies.
Lines of Business-Geospatial One-Stop: Promotes coordination and alignment of geospatial data collection and maintenance among all levels of government: provides one-stop web access to geospatial information through development of a portal; encourages collaborative planning for future investments in geospatial data; expands partnerships that help leverage investments and reduce duplication; and, facilitates partnerships and collaborative approaches in the sharing and stewardship of data. Up-to-date accessible information helps leverage resources and support programs: economic development, environmental quality and homeland security. HHS registers its geospatial data, making it available from the single access point.
Lines of Business-Federal Health Architecture: Creates a consistent Federal framework that improves coordination and collaboration on national Health Information Technology (HIT) Solutions; improves efficiency, standardization, reliability and availability to improve the exchange of comprehensive health information solutions, including health care delivery; and, to provide appropriate patient access to improved health data. HHS works closely with federal partners, state, local and tribal governments, including clients, consultants, collaborators and stakeholders who benefit directly from common vocabularies and technology standards through increased information sharing, increased efficiency, decreased technical support burdens and decreased costs.
Lines of Business ­Financial Management: Supports efficient and improved business performance while ensuring integrity in accountability, financial controls and mission effectiveness by enhancing process improvements; achieving cost savings; standardizing business processes and data models; promoting seamless data exchanges between Federal agencies; and, strengthening internal controls.
Lines of Business-Grants Management: Supports end-to-end grants management activities promoting improved customer service; decision making; financial management processes; efficiency of reporting procedure; and, postaward closeout actions. An HHS agency, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), is a GMLOB consortia lead, which has allowed ACF to take on customers external to HHS. These additional agency users have allowed HHS to reduce overhead costs for internal HHS users. Additionally, NIH is an internally HHS-designated Center of Excellence and has applied to be a GMLOB consortia lead. This effort has allowed HHS agencies using the NIH system to reduce grants management costs. Both efforts have allowed HHS to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies, as well as streamlining and standardization of grants processes, thus reducing overall HHS costs for grants management systems and processes.
Lines of Business-Budget Formulation and Execution: Allows sharing across the Federal government of common budget formulation and execution practices and processes resulting in improved practices within HHS.
Lines of Business­IT Infrastructure: A recent effort, this initiative provides the potential to leverage spending on commodity IT infrastructure to gain savings; to promote and use common, interoperable architectures that enable data sharing and data standardization; secure data interchanges; and, to grow a Federal workforce with interchangeable skills and tool sets.

CDC is co-chairing the FHA surveillance working group and has actively participated in the interoperability working group and the data architecture working group. CDC met the October 2003 goal for the Government Paperwork Elimination Act to make all information collections and disseminations available electronically.
CDC E-GOV Initiatives
ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
CDC continues to advance in its Enterprise Architecture (EA) development. Recent accomplishments include ongoing work of CDC's Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB) made up of Agency-wide representatives; closer linkage with the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process; and actively contributing to HHS' EA Model Working Group and EA Review Board. The resulting effort has raised CDC to Level 3 of OMB Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF). In addition to modeling CDC's Health Alerts Domain, the EA team has expanded its guidance into other key public health related functions, such as laboratory informatics.
SECURITY
CDC actively participates in the HHS Secure One program by maturing its strong information security program which is comprised of a Certification and Accreditation (C&A) and security assessment program, information security awareness training, policy development, test and evaluation, and security operations activities. CDC has focused on increasing effectiveness and efficiencies this year by identifying common controls that can be applied across the enterprise and beginning to implement master system security plans that take advantage of those security controls to meet NIST requirements. CDC again completed Business Continuity Planning and testing for all of the 24 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) critical systems and Business Continuity activities continue on an ongoing basis. CDC has further refined its Plan of Action and Milestone program to manage, mitigate, and validate remediation of system and enterprise weaknesses.

CDC consolidated all of its more than 40 health information hotlines and clearinghouses into one consolidated consumer response service at 1-800-CDC-INFO. The service went live in March 2005 with the initial conversion of HIV/AIDS, STDs, and immunization hotlines. Additional health topic areas have been successfully converted such as Emergency Preparedness, Cancer, Physical Activity and Nutrition, Diabetes and School Health, Birth Defects, Smoking and Health, Injury, TB, and Environmental Health. Currently, there are 3,794 prepared responses available in the data base to support programs that have already transitioned. The new service handles public inquiries 24 hours per day, every day, in bilingual and services hearing impaired callers. The contact center handled greater than 550,000 calls and 11,000 emails during the first year of operation and is continually growing as new health topics are added to the contact service.
FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE
In compliance with the Federal Real Property Asset Management Initiative, CDC has established a Senior Real Property Officer and a Federal Real Property Council to ensure that the CDC is meeting the guidelines that have been established by the initiative:
· Senior Real Property Officer- This Officer was designated to serve as the senior manager tasked with developing and implementing an agency asset management plan. Specifically, the Officer will: identify and categorize any real property owned, leased, or otherwise managed by the agency; prioritize actions to be taken to improve the operational and financial management of inventory; make life-cycle cost estimations associated with the prioritized actions; identify legislative authorities that are required to address the priorities; identify and pursue goals and targets with appropriate time frames and deadlines; provide advice on adequate budget amounts for activities; and focus on those activities and efforts allowed under current law.
· Federal Real Property Council- This Council will serve as a working group to facilitate the success of the agency's asset management plans. The Council will be composed of all agency Senior Real Property Officers, the Controller of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Administrator of General Services. The Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget will be a member and serve as the chair of the Council. The Council will establish appropriate performance measurements for evaluating the costs and benefits involved with acquiring, repairing, maintaining, operating, managing, and disposing of Federal real properties at particular agencies. The Council will also serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in evaluating actual progress in the implementation of real property enhancements.
BUDGET AND PERFORMANCE INTEGRATION INITIATIVE
CDC's efforts to integrate budget and performance have increased as the agency implements a new strategy and organization. The agency continues to modernize to enhance health impact, support the capacity to respond to public health emergencies, and directly engage CDC's customers, the American public.
Across CDC, integration efforts are reflected in the development of the agency's Performance Budget. This document aggregates performance information, required under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), with budget information. The Performance Budget reflects:
· an emphasis on outcome-oriented measures that demonstrate the focus of CDC's programs.
· efficiency measures for all programs, per OMB instruction via the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) review.
· full costs calculated at the goal and performance measure level.
· coordination across CDC throughout the development of the FY 2008 Performance Budget and other integration activities.
SENIOR AGENCY MANAGER MEETINGS
CDC has implemented a Senior Agency Management retreat cycle to review its goals and objectives and the financial and performance information needed to accomplish them. The Executive Leadership Board (ELB) met in early January. The Center Leadership Council (CLC) met in late January and CDC Division Directors met in early February. Managers discussed annual goal plans, how effective CDC was in meeting those goals, how CDC's budget is aligned with goals, and what measures should be implemented in future years to improve the effectiveness of the agency in accomplishing its goals.
In addition, CDC has aligned agency PART measures with the CDC goal areas. Each ELB member with responsibility for a goal area will report on performance to other Board members.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA
Senior Agency managers from CDC's Financial Management Office (FMO), Office of Strategy and Innovation (OSI), and Coordinating Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response (COTPER) collaborated on the FY 2006 spend-plan process. The spend plan process was formulated to fund programs based on performance rather than allocation and is intended to map program success and methods used to budget and track resources contributing to health impacts. COTPER and OSI reviews and evaluates projects and provides recommendations on funding. Projects recommended for funding were submitted to FMO for a detailed review of the project budget, and finally, submitted to the Executive Leadership Board and HHS for final approval.
Additionally, senior managers from CDC's OSI, FMO, COPTER, Procurement and Grants Office (PGO), and the Management Information Systems Office (MISO) collaborated to develop FY 2006 joint planning activities for budget, goals, and extramural awards. This collaborative effort created a single planning process supported by Integrated Resources Information System (IRIS), budget and performance integration, and CDC's newly created health impact web-based system that will link resources to performance. CDC's health impact system is a tool which will allow staff to track projects, performance, budget, and health impact through a uniform electronic system across the agency.
CDC leadership held meetings to discuss the best strategies to fully implement the HHS Performance Management Appraisal Program. Part of the meetings were dedicated to finalizing a timeline for CDC policy development and analyzing historical funding data related to the new percentages of awards to forecast for budget impact in FY 2007.
Monthly and ad hoc financial management meetings occur at all levels of the organization with and between Coordinating Center Directors, Chief Management Officials, Division Directors and Branch Chief to define and establish clear objectives for both program and budget. Regular meetings are scheduled reinforcing or modifying goals as program and financial situations change.
PART
In 2002 through 2006, 22 CDC programs participated in a PART review by OMB: 317 Immunization Program, Breast and Cervical Cancer, Diabetes, Domestic HIV/AIDS Prevention, HAN, ATSDR, State and Local Preparedness, B&F, Epidemic Services and Response, Occupational Safety and Health, Infectious Diseases, STD/TB, Environmental Health, Global AIDS, in conjunction with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Global Immunization, Health Statistics and the Strategic National Stockpile, Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Injury Prevention and Control, BioSurveillance and Upgrading CDC Capacity. These programs have developed performance measures which are reported on in each submission of the performance budget. Many of the performance measures are outcome-oriented and support the direction of CDC's goals process. Many programs reviewed by PART have made improvements in strategy, program management and results based on OMB's recommendations. For example:
· CDC has initiated a business improvement project to revamp the entire vaccine distribution process which will strengthen the efficiency and accountability of vaccine management systems. Once fully implemented, the new systems will automate and integrate vaccine ordering and management by centralizing distribution of all public purchased vaccines.
· Breast and Cervical Cancer performance targets were increased in accordance with data submitted by the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) Federal Advisory Committee. This review was solicited as an independent verification of the effectiveness of the program in general, and a report of the first 12 years of the Breast and Cervical Cancer program was prepared and endorsed.
· CDC's Diabetes program completed a management analysis to determine how resources (i.e. human capital, time and funds) are being used to achieve National Program Objectives (NPO). The analysis successfully captured the internal and external influence, interaction and impact of resources.
· CDC's Domestic HIV/AIDS Prevention program developed a template for project officers' use to analyze progress reports from state health departments, Community-Based Organizations and providers. CDC is phasing-in the implementation of the Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) which will allow CDC to augment qualitative data from grantee annual progress reports with quantitative data to show client and program effectiveness.
· CDC's Environmental Health program and ATSDR initiated an intramural review program to evaluate all of its activities and projects with the goal of identifying shortcomings and making recommendations for improvement. This program is conducted by the Peer Review Subcommittee of their Board of Scientific Counselors, an independent organization whose charter is to provide guidance to the program. The subcommittee will evaluate the entire Environmental Health program within the next five years.
· CDC has entered into a contract with the National Academies (NA) to conduct a comprehensive review of its occupational safety and health research program portfolio. In FY 2005, the NA Framework Committee established comprehensive evaluation criteria. To conduct the first phase of review, a NA evaluation panel

was assembled and employed the criteria to review mining and hearing loss prevention. NA panels are in the process of reviewing the mining and hearing loss programs and will provide a formal report with ratings in September 2006.
· ATSDR implemented a new long-term outcome measure for documenting the effectiveness of its interventions at sites that pose the most urgent public health hazards. ATSDR now evaluates its interventions at each site to determine their impact on public health. As a result, this new measure has focused the agency's leadership, its Cooperative Agreement Partners, and EPA on achieving public health outcomes.
· Critical tasks and performance measures were developed for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement Program and were incorporated into the grant guidance for FY 2005.
· CDC's Occupational Safety and Health program initiated a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact and relevance of occupational safety and health research.
· CDC's Infectious Diseases program has a website to post performance data on the grantee profile pages, including funding, activities funded, links to the grantees home page, grantee contact information and Congressional summaries (available for a limited number of grantees).
· CDC's TB program began to award state health department cooperative agreements for a new project cycle utilizing a new funding formula based on the burden of the disease.
Efficiency Measures
All CDC PART programs have at least one OMB-approved efficiency measure. These efficiency measures, along with their targets and actual performance, can be found in the Detail of Performance Analysis sections of this document.
FULL COST
CDC continues to report the full costs calculated at the goal and performance measure level in the Performance Budget. The full cost table has been changed to include the allocation of costs to the Vaccines for Children Program.
FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVE
CDC/CCHIS/NCHM's Division of Partnerships and Strategic Alliances Faith Based and Community Organization (FBCO) Team was established to facilitate the development of partnerships between public health and FBCOs in order to provide more effective health and human services.
Prepare for an Influenza Pandemic: Deploy a national communications strategy to provide accurate, timely, consistent, and comprehensive information about preparing for and responding to influenza and pandemic influenza to the public, the news media, health care providers, and other partners and stakeholders.
· Collaboration between FBCOs and CDC's Emergency Communications System. CDC led a series of focus groups about how best to communicate with FBCOs during emergencies. Invited participants included: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Salvation Army, the National Council of Churches' Church World Service, the Hindu nonprofit charity BAPS Care International, the United Way of America, the United Methodist Committee on Relief, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, CAUSE-NY/Jewish Community Relations Council of NY; the Emory Interfaith Health Program; the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (National VOAD); the Regional Council of Churches of Atlanta, Inc. and Southern Baptist Disaster Relief.
Enhance Emergency Response: Prepare faith-based and community organizations to prevent and address the health effects of a disaster. CDC has increased the nation's preparedness for a potential influenza pandemic and other health emergencies by:
· Serving as the lead author for the HHS Faith-based and Community Organization Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Checklist released by Secretary Leavitt on January 10, 2006. This checklist is a resource to provide various FBCOs with broad guidance on how to begin planning for pandemic influenza. The checklist has widespread geographic distribution and has been used by many diverse organizations. More than 61,000 FBCOs refer to or link to the checklist.
· Serving as the lead agency for the October 5-6, 2006 Roundtable discussions with FBCOs about pandemic influenza preparedness. At the request of the White House Homeland Security Council, CDC served as lead organizers working with the HHS Center for Faith Based and Community Initiatives and other federal

agencies to host roundtable discussions with faith-based, community-based, volunteer, and non-profit organizations about ways to reduce a severe flu pandemic.
· Participants included individuals from these and many other organizations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the American Red Cross, Asbury Theological Seminary, the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints, the Jewish Community Relations Council, the Muslim Women's Institute for Research and Development, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, National 4-H Clubs, the Southern Baptist Convention, United Jewish Communities, the United Way of America, the Urban Institute and World Vision International.
· Developing a Partnership with the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (National VOAD). CDC established and oversees monthly conference calls with the National VOAD, an umbrella organization of over 40 nonprofit and faith-based agencies that regularly participate in disaster response. The American Red Cross and the National VOAD are the only nongovernmental organizations that are signatories to the National Response Plan. The National Response Plan does not name charities active in disaster relief other than the American Red Cross, but instead incorporates them into the National VOAD.
· Organizing a Pandemic Planning Webinar with National VOAD. On December 8, 2006, CDC delivered a pandemic planning Webinar with the National VOAD member organizations and others.
· Organizing a Pandemic Planning Webinar for National Jewish Organizations. On December 5, 2006, CDC delivered a pandemic planning Webinar for National Jewish Organizations. Over 130 Jewish Federations from across North America participated.
· Developing a Partnership with the Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA). CDC is collaborating on pandemic influenza preparedness planning with IMANA, a Muslim nonprofit public charity active in health initiatives and other humanitarian efforts.
· Developing a Partnership with BAPS Care International: CDC is collaborating on pandemic influenza preparedness planning with BAPS Care International which is a Hindu 501(c) (3)-registered nonprofit international public charity active in health and disaster relief efforts.
· Developing a pandemic planning course for FBCOs in partnership with the Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN). CDC is working with EDEN to develop a pandemic influenza training that will be delivered through the Land Grant University system which includes Land Grant Universities in each of the 50 states and extension agents in the counties of each of the states.
· Delivering numerous presentations about pandemic planning and emergency preparedness to FBCOs. For example, CDC staff will give a presentation on Pandemic Influenza Preparedness at the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc. Christian Education Summit in January 2007 in Houston, Texas. This network includes 2.5 million pastors, teachers and leaders in African American communities across the U.S., United Kingdom, Africa, Bahamas, Cuba and throughout the world.
Emphasize Faith Based and Community Solutions: Meet the OMB mandated "Green" Standards for Success and Best Practices Referenced in Standards. CDC has taken several critical steps to ensure that it is meeting the OMB "Green" Standards for Success by:
· Participation in the FY 2006 Annual Report to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives data collection efforts.
· Reporting efforts to educate agency staff on the requirements of the HHS Equal Treatment Regulations.
· Supporting numerous White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Regional Conferences and Workshops. These targeted workshops are designed to help FBCOs learn more about President Bush's Faith-Based and Community Initiative and offer grant writing tutorials for certain Federal grant programs that present some of the greatest opportunities for FBCOs.
· Referring FBCOs to sign up for the HHS CFBCI Weekly Digest for Faith-Based and Community Organizations. This weekly digest summarizes grant opportunities at CDC and HHS for which faithbased/community organizations are eligible to apply.
· Collaborating with other federal agencies and offices on Grant Writing Workshops for FBCOs and panel reviews, for example:
­ On March 28-30, 2006, attended the Faith-Based and Community Partners' Grant writing and Fund Development Project sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

Support community-based approaches to reduce health disparities that affect racial, ethnic, and under- served populations. Some examples of community-based approaches to reduce health disparities include the following:
· Rapid HIV testing initiative with African American Churches for 2007 National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness and Information Day. CDC is leading a collaborative project involving Recovery Consultants of Atlanta, Inc., the Institute for Health Protection, the United Way of Atlanta, CDC National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, SAMHSA, CMS, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church and the Interdenominational Theological Center on a Rapid HIV testing initiative with African American Churches as part of the 2007 National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness and Information Day.
· Presentation at the 2007 National Immunization Conference. From 1995 to 2005, while immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines increased approximately 20% nationally, they increased more than 30% in Jefferson County, AL. This presentation will discuss Shepherd's Watch, a partnership between the Jefferson County Health Department and 38 churches representing diverse racial/ethnic communities. The county health department facilitated partnerships between eight churches and five medical centers to host eight free immunization clinics in urban areas; provided Shepherd's Watch partners with quarterly updates on immunization activities and recommendations; provided education to over 15,000 congregants; and gave technical assistance on how to implement immunization follow-up programs.
· Two-day consultation meeting on Faith and HIV Prevention. In February 2006, CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, STD, and TB Prevention held a two-day consultation meeting with 29 leaders from many faiths, including Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Hebrew-Israelite, Muslim, and Buddhism.
· National Coalition of Pastors' Spouses. CDC's National Diabetes Education Program is working with the National Coalition of Pastors' Spouses, a national health and wellness initiative embedded in African American churches which focuses on health disparities.
· AME Church, 2006 influenza vaccination clinic pilot. Staff from CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases provided technical assistance to AME health officials as part of AME Church's influenza vaccination campaign.

· CDC session at 2006 Global Summit on AIDS and the Church. Various CDC staff presented a session at the Global Summit on AIDS and the Church, Nov. 30-Dec. 1, 2006. The Purpose Driven network includes over 400,000 church leaders and congregations in every country. CDC presented information about HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and diseases from unsafe water affecting vulnerable populations in developing countries.
· Safe Water Projects with FBCOs. CDC is working with Emory University School of Public Health, Emory Interfaith-Health Program, CARE and other international NGOs and FBCOs to identify ways to equip FBCOs for Safe Water Projects which aid vulnerable populations in developing countries.
· FBCO Personal Health Record Initiative. This initiative will illume how Personal Health Records (PHRs) can empower and improve the quality and efficiency of health care for African Americans, as well as, how social and physical transactions among clergy, congregants and the community can influence PHR adoption in the African American community
Inform and educate federal grantees, including state and local officials who administer funds, about the requirements of the Equal Treatment regulations. The HHS Equal Treatment Regulations are designed to remove barriers to the participation of FBCOs in HHS programs. CDC ensures that staff and partners are aware of these regulations in several ways:
· CDC distributed the HHS Equal Treatment Regulations through the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National Association of Local Boards of Health, and the National Association of City and County Health Officials to state and local public health agencies administering CDC grants/cooperative agreements
