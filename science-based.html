CDC will continue its efforts in conjunction with these partners to establish a multi-year, comprehensive approach to more effectively prevent and control Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections including Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, and to promote appropriate surveillance for these conditions. CDC's program emphasizes the goal of working with Lyme disease endemic communities to develop an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach which includes a wide assortment of practical tick control strategies. IPM employs environmental management, biological and chemical control of ticks, and enhanced personal protection through tick avoidance and other measures to prevent Lyme disease.

Using national survey data and Medicare data on amputations, this study used various statistical models to develop projections of lowerextremity amputation (LEA). These analyses suggested that the number of persons with diabetes experiencing amputations is likely to grow rapidly between 2002 and 2050 among those less than 75 years of age. However, these projections of lower extremity amputations varied widely by the assumptions used to model the projections. The study concluded that additional years of data and additional statelevel measures of diabetes care practices (e.g., foot exam, A1c testing) are needed for more reliable projections of amputations and to link programmatic diabetes care practices with health outcomes among people with diabetes. Therefore, CDC does not have sufficient data at this time to develop <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> goals for this health outcome. The program is exploring feasible alternatives to developing goals. Meanwhile, CDC continues to monitor trends in LEA and End-Stage Renal Disease in trend with either decreasing rates or rates that are leveling off.

In 1989, CDC set a goal to eliminate TB in the U.S., with elimination defined as less than one case per 1,000,000 persons. This goal was reaffirmed in 1999 by the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) and in 2000 by the IOM. Elimination of TB is a long-term goal that requires developing new tools and fully implementing the strategies recommended by the IOM. Success in achieving this goal, and ultimately TB elimination depends on: (1) treating infectious patients quickly and completely; (2) treating them with drugs that work; (3) treating their close contacts; (4) treating persons with latent infection who are at high risk of developing the disease; (5) maintaining timely, complete local, state, and national TB information systems to monitor elimination efforts; and (6) helping to control the spread of TB globally.

The Community Guide is a family of printed and internet products that accurately encapsulate the available scientific evidence about what works to promote health and prevent disease in states, communities, local organizations, healthcare organizations, worksites, and schools. It provides one-stop shopping for scientificallybased recommendations about the use of effective public health programs and policies. The Community Guide is produced in close collaboration with an independent, non-federal Task Force on Community Preventive Services and numerous other scientific and public health partners. It evaluates and communicates state of the art knowledge about the effectiveness, economic efficiency, and feasibility of interventions to promote community health and prevent disease.

Funds provided to CDC for these activities are used to provide foundational and catalytic support for global field epidemiology training and sustainable management and development. The funds are utilized for 1) curriculum development--ensuring that the programs keep current with state-of the-art methodologies and public health best practices, and 2) ongoing technical assistance from Atlanta for the countries implementing these two programs. In addition, some of these funds support activities in the host country, but these funds are highly leveraged, with additional funding coming for a diverse set of global partners. As an example, the average annual cost of a Field Epidemiology (and Laboratory) Training is $1 million. CDC is not the only agency who contributes to this total. Other federal agencies, including USAID and DOD, and private sector partners have recognized the value of this long-standing and highly effective program and collaborate to support country-level program implementation. Furthermore, host countries must also commit resources in order to participate. CDC generally supports a FE(L)TP program for about five years. During the first few years of a program, a large proportion of funding supports one or two CDC staff in the host country and technical support. The host country initially provides office space and staff and, as the program progresses, gradually takes on additional program costs such as trainee support, travel, equipment/supplies, books, etc. This gradual transfer of responsibility and program costs helps to ensure that the country can sustain the program once CDC staff are no longer present within country. Because CDC funds are so highly leveraged, the outputs of these programs (such as number of countries, number of graduates, etc) do not necessarily support increases or decreases in the appropriated budget. However, these appropriations ensure the development of <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> curricula that reflect current global public health challenges.

CDC applies these techniques to provide an effective and timely response to a threat to take appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of an incident on the American public. Emergency response and recovery operations are provided through a variety of functions including 24/7 emergency response and support, emergency exercises and training, public health impact assessments, technical assistance and risk and emergency communication. SNS activities are undertaken during the response and recovery phases of a disaster to minimize morbidity and mortality from all threats of national significance as reflected in CDC's Response and Recovery all-hazards preparedness objective.

The NACP aims to reduce the number of asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, school- and workdays missed, and limitations on activity. To accomplish these objectives, the NACP provides funding to its grantees to support activities such as increasing the use of asthma management plans by persons with diagnosed asthma; providing education and training to increase the knowledge of asthma among providers, school personnel, and persons living with asthma; and supporting asthma case management activities. In FY 2008, the NACP provided support to 33 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Funding to public health departments accounted for over 50 percent of the program`s budget. In FY 2009, a new competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (EH09-901) for the "Addressing Asthma from a Public Health Perspective" initiative of the NACP was released. The cooperative agreements will be for a five year project period, and will provide funding to state health agencies to identify and track those most affected by asthma, build partnerships, and develop and implement <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> interventions for the nation`s most vulnerable populations.

Shortly thereafter, in 1980, CDC began studying patterns of violence. Since the establishment of CDC`s violence prevention program in 1992, CDC has been using the public health approach to prevent injuries and deaths caused by violence. To do this, CDC supports a range of activities, including data collection to identify risk and protective factors, evaluation of prevention strategies, and widespread use of prevention approaches based on the best available science. CDC utilizes public health data to determine who is at risk, where, and at what times for specific types of violence.

Childhood lead poisoning prevention activities have reduced the prevalence of lead poisoning more than 10-fold since 1976. Our nation is close to realizing the dream of eliminating childhood lead poisoning as a large-scale public health issue, which will be an outstanding public health success. Because the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program has worked closely with state, local, tribal, and private officials to eliminate childhood lead poisoning, a nationwide network of trained personnel knowledgeable about lead poisoning prevention and related activities has been created. In addition to lead paint hazards, this network is now poised to address in an integrated and holistic fashion additional hazards in houses, including radon, injury hazards, disease carrying rodents and insects, mold, fires, contaminated drinking water, septic systems, and asthma triggers. A detailed operational plan has been created to expedite the program`s transformation into a Healthy Housing Program. Next steps include continuing to research <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> interventions to reduce health hazards in houses and to establish pilot projects to create and test models for future healthy housing programs. Pilot project awardees will submit data to CDC that will provide a view of the potential structures for healthy housing programs at the state/tribal, and local level, as well as the programs` ability to ensure healthy housing training takes place, establish referral networks, and to collect and analyze program data. Additionally, the CDC National Lead Poisoning Prevention Training Center will expand its training capacity from 160 in FY 2008 to 200 in FY 2009. The Healthy Housing Component will be expanded in the curriculum.

Many of these decisions are made in face-to-face consultations with health care providers; however, many more are made in places such as grocery and drug stores, workplaces, playgrounds, clinics, online, and around the kitchen table. Additionally, people do not deal with one health issue at a time and are often making decisions in a communication environment that is full of misinformation and unhealthful advertising on complex and unfamiliar issues. To make informed decisions and take actions that protect and promote their health, people need information that they can access, understand and use. Yet, two decades of research indicates that much health information is presented in ways that are not understandable by most Americans. CDC provides leadership in <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> health and risk communication and marketing, both domestically and internationally.

Through CCDPP, all grantees are expected to achieve population level change in the specified outcomes and to identify populations disproportionately affected by the condition being addressed and to implement strategies to narrow gaps in health status between these special populations and the population as a whole. Grantees will also address evaluation and delivery of evidence-based interventions in their annual plan to CDC. Within the total program level, up to 20 percent is dedicated for CDC technical assistance, evaluation, oversight, and management activities. Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities The FY 2012 budget request of $143.899 million for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities is $273,000 below the FY 2010 level. The FY 2012 request consolidates disease specific funding into three new budget lines: Child Health and Development, Health and Development for People with Disabilities, and Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders. These budget lines represent new comprehensive programs that refocus activities to integrated and competitive grant programs that facilitate more effective approaches. This approach gives CDC greater flexibility to address critical public health challenges and allocate resources to maximize the public health impact. CDC, working with external stakeholders, may continue some existing programs as currently structured, expand others, redirect resources to more effective activities, change the scope of existing activities based on effectiveness and need, and if appropriate, use existing program resources to start new activities or end existing programs. Healthy Home and Community Environments The FY 2012 budget request of $32.674 million for the Healthy Home and Community Environments program is $33.045 million the FY 2010 level.

Teen dating violence is one area of growing concern in violence prevention. In 2011, almost one in 10 high school students reported experiencing physical violence from a dating partner (Measure 7.1.2b). Teen victims of dating violence are more likely to be depressed and do poorly in school. They may engage in unhealthy behaviors, like using drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to have eating disorders. In extreme cases, some teens even think about or attempt suicide. Teens who are victims in high school are at higher risk for victimization during college. Current science demonstrates it is most effective to begin working with teens at a younger age to stop dating violence before it starts. CDC is actively identifying effective programmatic strategies and will work to further implement programs that are based on the best available science.

Program goals are: (1) strengthening the ability of public health agencies to benefit from and manage advances in electronic health information; and (2) fostering innovation, identifying best practices, sharing knowledge, and serving as the primary resource for issues in public health informatics. Through this program, CDC translates public health needs into information processes that are valued, strategic, and consistent with the larger health information technology (IT) world. This involves processing approximately 1.5 billion electronic messages exchanging public health information per year on behalf of CDC programs and state health departments. Informatics-based solutions improve public health information exchange in the areas of surveillance, emergency preparedness, laboratory services, and other public health activities. CDC strives to improve electronic data exchange across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries among state and local health departments and CDC programs.

CDC supports interventions that are evidence-based, specifically community water fluoridation and dental sealants. Community water fluoridation benefits people of all ages and socioeconomic groups, including those difficult to reach through other public health programs and private dental care. Systematic reviews of studies have found that fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in adults and youth. The application of dental sealants on permanent molars soon after they appear (generally around 6 years of age) reduce decay in these teeth by 81% approximately 2 years after placement. DOH supports school based sealant programs that target schools with high populations of low-income children who are higher risk of dental decay. We also support states who provide oral health education and fluoride varnish application to younger children, however, there are currently no population based strategies (other than fluoridation) for children under five and pregnant women that have an evidence base of effectiveness. DOH will continue to review the science and evaluate the effectiveness of our state oral health infrastructure grants to identify refinements that maximize effective use of these funds to improve the oral health of all Americans.

This effort will build on work initiated in 2014, when CDC and HRSA encouraged state and local AIDS programs to integrate their HIV planning activities. CDC will continue to evaluate how well existing strategies used by health departments and their collaborative partners to engage persons in care are working in practice, identify new approaches to improve linkage to HIV care, and address barriers to receiving care. CDC will continue investing in the implementation of prevention strategies, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In 2014, CDC released new clinical guidelines recommending PrEP31 as one prevention option for patients at substantial risk for HIV infection. CDC is working with partners to determine how to deliver PrEP and other biomedical interventions to high risk HIV-negative persons in the most cost-effective way. CDC will share findings from our prevention research with other HIV prevention partners, including federal research agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal and state HIV partners, to inform their prevention efforts and ensure HIV-infected persons receive the care they need. CDC's prevention research also results in the development of recommendations and guidance based on the latest science. Communications Campaigns--CDC raises awareness about the HIV epidemic in the United States and promotes HIV prevention and testing through the Act Against AIDS initiative.32 This initiative seeks to combat HIV-related stigma, raise awareness, and normalize testing and other risk reduction behaviors, particularly for populations at high risk for HIV. The Act Against AIDS initiative has generated more than 10.1 billion impressions since launced in 2009. In 2014, various Act Against AIDS communication efforts generated more than 2.87 billion impressions, more than 1.2 million visits to campaign websites, 122,844 searches for HIV testing locations, and more than 8 million views of campaign public service announcements and videos. In December 2015, CDC launched a new National HIV Testing Campaign "Doing It." that encourages all adults to get tested for HIV. In keeping with CDC recommendations for HIV testing, "Doing It" emphasizes the importance of testing for all people ages 1864.

CDC will continue to provide funding and technical assistance to state and local education agencies to implement school HIV and STD prevention activities for youth, particularly those at disproportionate risk for HIV infection. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) identifies the education of all Americans about the threat of HIV and how to prevent it as a critical step in reducing new infections in the United States. The NHAS emphasizes that educating young people about HIV before they begin engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for HIV infection is a priority. Toward this goal, CDC's HIV Adolescent and School Health program helps schools implement effective education programs to prevent HIV infection and other STDs among adolescents that are based on the best-available science. These school-based education programs are also expected to reduce teen pregnancy rates by reducing common risk factors. Youth have one of the highest rates of HIV incidence, with persons aged 1324 comprising 26% of all new HIV infections in 2010. Some youth are disproportionately affected (see figure below). Effective school-based education programs are needed to make youth aware of their risk for HIV; help delay initiation of sexual activity; increase condom use among those who are sexually active; and decrease other behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, which contribute to the risk of HIV infection. As described above, in FY 2017 CDC will explore opportunities to better use metrics around HIV diagnoses in youth.

Prior to the current outbreak only two LRN National laboratories were capable of performing an Ebola test: the DOD United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and CDC. By November 1, 2015, 57 LRN public health laboratories (PHLs) completed proficiency testing with the DOD Ebola assay. Also in November 2015, CDC deployed the CDC real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that contained an additional target for improved sensitivity to the 57 LRN laboratories. CDC continues to assure that LRN laboratories can handle Ebola specimens. National Syndromic Surveillance Program CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP)450 promotes and advances development of a syndromic surveillance system for the timely exchange of syndromic data. These data are used to improve nationwide situational awareness and enhance responsiveness to hazardous events and disease outbreaks to protect America's health, safety, and security. NSSP is an evolution of the BioSense program that moves the focus from a software solution to one that supports all aspects of syndromic surveillance needed to achieve mandates outlined in legislation for an integrated system of public health surveillance. NSSP functions through collaboration among individuals and organizations at local, state, and federal levels of public health; federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; public health partner organizations; and hospitals and health professionals. NSSP features include access to and use of the cloud-based BioSense Platform, a secure integrated electronic health information system with standardized analytic tools and processes. These tools enable users to rapidly collect, evaluate, share, and store syndromic surveillance data. By using the BioSense Platform, health officials can analyze syndromic data to improve their common awareness of health threats over time and across regional boundaries. NSSP also promotes a Community of Practice in which participants collaborate to advance the science and practice of syndromic surveillance. The NSSP Community of Practice includes CDC-funded awardees, non-funded states and jurisdictions that contribute data to the BioSense Platform, public health practitioners who use local syndromic surveillance systems, CDC programs, other federal agencies, partner organizations, hospitals, healthcare professionals, and academic institutions. The tools hosted on the BioSense Platform also increase the capacity of state and local health departments to support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Meaningful Use 450http://www.cdc.gov/nssp/index.html

As CDC enters the third decade of NORA, it remains committed to evaluating its relevance, impact and contributions. The most robust method to evaluate these qualities is through peer review. An analysis of five federal research agencies by the National Academy of Sciences found that all five agencies used peer review to evaluate the quality of their research programs. Furthermore, the National Academies of Science recommended that research agencies continue to use this approach.521 In FY 2017, CDC is introducing a new measure to demonstrate the effectiveness of occupational safety and health programs based on external reviews by the National Academies of Science (Measure 9.1.1a). The new measure builds on previous external evaluations of eight occupational safety and health programs conducted by the National Academies and subsequent progress reviews conducted by the Board of Scientific Counselors. The previous reviews were helpful in improving programs' impact and their ability to monitor progress. For example, the Construction Program's National Construction Center developed additional metrics to capture changes made due to "research to practice" efforts, which are now used by the NIOSH Office of Construction Safety and Health, Center for Construction Research and Training, and NIOSH construction researchers. In addition, the Respiratory Disease Research Program expanded work to enhance clinicians' recognition of workplace exposures as a cause of asthma and the subsequent clinical evaluation and care of work-related asthma. Starting in FY 2017, CDC will begin a new set of external peer reviews that focus on NIOSH's current priorities and activities (Measure 9.1.1a). Each year through FY 2021, two occupational safety and health programs will be reviewed by a group of external experts selected by the independent NIOSH Board of Scientific Counselors.522 Each program will be scored on relevance and impact. A total of 10 Sector and Cross-Sector programs will be reviewed over a five year period. CDC will assess the readiness of two new Sector Programs for peer review: Oil and Gas Extraction (which addresses occupational health and safety issues related to hydraulic fracturing, oil drilling, etc.), and Public Safety (which addresses health and safety for law enforcement, emergency medical services, firefighting, and corrections). The evaluations will provide useful feedback to programs on areas of success and challenges to address going forward. In a time of constrained resources, these data help determine the direction and future investment of occupational safety and health research at CDC to maximize public health impact.

This flagship HIV prevention program is a chief contributor to HIV prevention success in the United States, including increases in persons who know their HIV status as well as reductions in perinatal HIV infections and HIV diagnoses. CDC's support for state and local health departments encompasses not just funding, but program guidance and technical assistance, including assistance in seeking reimbursement for services that may be covered under health insurance policies (e.g., billing for testing for HIV and related co-infections in health care settings, counseling, and vaccination). CDC also assists health departments in monitoring and evaluating performance and holds programs accountable for implementing high impact prevention strategies. Investing in HIV Surveillance CDC's surveillance activities, which take place in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, are essential to identifying and targeting prevention efforts--including HIV testing--towards populations that have high rates of acquiring and transmitting HIV. CDC investments in HIV surveillance data provide important information on the number of people living with HIV in the U.S., and national trend data. CDC also tracks how well states, cities, and local communities are doing in getting patients into care, keeping them in care, and achieving viral suppression. High quality surveillance data assesses the delivery of services to people living with HIV across the entire continuum of care: HIV diagnosis, linkage to and retention in HIV medical care, starting and staying on antiretroviral therapy, and suppressing viral load. In addition, surveillance efforts serve as a resource for health information across CDC on youth, and play a critical role in documenting public health trends and challenges. They also provide invaluable information for state and local decision-making. Surveillance activities include monitoring adolescent health risk behaviors and school-based HIV prevention activities such as health education, health services, and safe and supportive environments. Investing in Efforts to Improve Program Effectiveness and Identifying Effective HIV Prevention Approaches CDC investments support prevention research and demonstration projects in several domains that are crucial to support successful HIV prevention programs in health departments and community-based organizations. These domains include epidemiological and laboratory science, outbreak investigation and response, social and behavioral science, and statistical and economic analyses. This work includes efforts to identify better strategies CDC grantees can use to link persons with HIV to care, to engage and retain them in HIV medical care, and promote adherence to their antiretroviral medication regimens. Also, these investments support laboratory research, in collaboration with NIH, to identify new biomedical approaches to HIV prevention, as well as outbreak investigation and response efforts needed to interrupt active networks of transmission. Resources support providing public and clinical care providers with information on effective HIV prevention strategies, so they can best protect themselves or their patients from acquiring or transmitting HIV. Finally, CDC also examines how new biomedical and bio-behavioral interventions are being used in communities to improve HIV prevention and identifies related best practices that can be shared nationally to maximize the impact of our prevention efforts. Investing in National, Regional, Local, Community, and Other Organizations CDC invests in prevention across America at the community level. CDC formally partners with community based organizations to expand the impact and reach of HIV prevention activities in communities disproportionately affected by HIV and has since the late 1980's. Community based organizations' access, history and credibility with members of most affected communities, enables the organizations to be recognized as, and remain

CDC partners with community-based organizations to focus on HIV testing, linkage to and retention in HIV medical care, support services for persons living with HIV and for HIV negative persons living in communities most affected by HIV, as well as other effective interventions. CDC ensures that resources are effectively targeted to areas where the majority of HIV diagnoses are occurring in the United States. Investing in School Health CDC also invests in school-based support for effective programs to prevent HIV infection and other STDs among adolescents. These school-based programs are expected to delay initiation of sexual activity in adolescents through skill-building, support of healthy behaviors in school environments, and the promotion of parent involvement. CDC funds state education agencies (SEAs) and local education agencies (LEAs) to provide health education and services, reaching approximately 1.7 million students in the United States. Funding is used to implement effective disease prevention and health promotion strategies to prevent risk for HIV and other STDs, including sexual risk, substance use, and other associated risk factors (e.g., violence). Jurisdictions where nearly 62% of the HIV diagnoses among 15-19 year olds in the United States were diagnosed are served by CDC's program. CDC partners with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to help state and local grantees effectively implement their HIV/STD prevention efforts. CDC also invests in organizations that provide <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> training and capacity building support for partner organizations to strengthen and sustain the capabilities of the HIV prevention workforce serving youth. These investments ensure that on-the-ground prevention programs and their staff have the skills, information, and organizational support needed to best serve people living with, and at risk for, HIV in their communities.

Increased investments to build a strong, sustainable public health system infrastructure through innovative disease surveillance systems, enhanced workforce capacity, and evidence based public health practices are vital to addressing challenges to the social and economic infrastructure the nation is urgently facing. CDC's public health scientific services provide expertise in public heath surveillance systems and informatics, epidemiologic analysis, and laboratory standards and services. CDC supports public health science through various surveillance systems. These efforts include using external sources of information, and sharing best practices in collecting, managing, and using information among CDC programs and the public health community.

In FY 2018, CDC will continue to maintain the world's most advanced, state-of-the-art environmental public health laboratory. Better Disease Diagnosis and Treatment by Improving the Quality of Laboratory Tests Accurate and precise laboratory measurements are essential for correct diagnosis and treatment of disease. CDC uses expert measurement science to improve the accuracy, precision, and cost effectiveness of laboratory tests for environmental chemicals, nutrition indicators, heart disease, chronic diseases, and newborn screening. The lab develops reference methods and materials and provides quality assurance programs and trainings to assure the quality of tests in state, clinical, research, and academic laboratories. CDC's efforts reach more than 2,000 domestic and international laboratories, helping reduce diagnosis and treatment errors, unneeded medical procedures, and repeat laboratory tests. In FY 2018, CDC will provide quality assurance programs and materials, conduct trainings, and transfer laboratory testing methods to state, local, research, and clinical laboratories. CDC will help state newborn screening programs use new molecular testing techniques to improve detection of diseases like cystic fibrosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. CDC will continue partnering with private sector companies and laboratory test manufacturers to improve accuracy and precision of test results. Earlier Identification of New Diseases in Newborns by Supporting State Screening CDC works directly with laboratories in states to implement newborn screening for new diseases, providing training, technical assistance, and quality assurance materials that help ensure accurate test results. Since 2008, CDC has worked to increase the number of states and territories that conduct newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a deadly disease that is curable if treated soon after birth. To date, CDCfunded programs have screened more than two million babies for SCID and serve as models for other states implementing population-based screening. CDC recognizes that states and territories need support implementing testing for other treatable newborn diseases. Since 2015, three additional conditions have been added to the list HHS recommends for screening, but no more than two states are testing for any condition. In FY 2018, CDC will begin a two-year cooperative agreement with up to three states to provide necessary laboratory equipment, staffing, and supplies to conduct population-based testing for new conditions. These awards will build on CDC's successful newborn screening program and utilize CDC's unique expertise in working with state newborn screening laboratories.

Globally, there are 37 million people living with HIV, with 2 million new infections each year. Investments in controlling the HIV epidemic now will reduce the number of new infections and total number of persons living with HIV, which will both save lives and also decrease future costs of the epidemic. CDC plays an essential role in the fight against HIV by ensuring that science and practice rapidly evolve to accomplish the most efficient, high impact public health results. As an implementer41 of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), CDC works to support strong, sustainable national HIV programs and public health systems that can effectively lead their countries' sustained response to the epidemic, as well as to other global health threats, ultimately protecting Americans at home. CDC uses its expertise in public health science, long-standing partnerships with ministries of health, community organizations and other global partners to establish country-driven programs and systems, with a focus on ensuring high-quality HIV monitoring and evaluation to drive evidence-based decisions. CDC provides HIV scientific and programmatic support and mentoring, serving over 50 countries in Africa, Asia, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The U.S. government support of life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and large-scale implementation of combination prevention programs saves lives, prevents new infections, improves health, and protects families and communities. CDC, through its work with PEPFAR and in-country partners, has helped reduce AIDS-related deaths by 45% since 2004 by focusing on accountability, quality, and the use of data to improve decision-making and to enhance program focus. In 2016, as a key driver of U.S. progress through PEPFAR, CDC was responsible for:

The number of overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics quadrupled from 1999 to 2013. In response to this growing public health crisis, CDC has launched its Overdose Prevention in States (OPIS) effort as means to equip states with resources and expertise needed to reverse this epidemic. CDC's Prescription Drug Overdose Prevention for States (PfS) program funds 29 state health departments to advance and evaluate comprehensive state-level interventions for preventing opioid-related overdose, misuse, and abuse. CDC will measure progress in reducing overdose deaths involving opioids among the 29 states funded specifically for PfS. In addition to CDC's state-based opioid prevention programs, the agency will continue implementation of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain which was released in March 2016. Improving the way opioids are prescribed through clinical practice guidelines can ensure patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment while reducing the number of people who misuse, abuse, or overdose from these drugs. CDC's Core SVIPP program provides support to state health departments to disseminate, implement, and evaluate best practices and <a href='#' class='text-danger'>science-based</a> strategies for injury and violence prevention programs. The Core SVIPP grantees use surveillance data to inform injury and violence prevention activities. In 2016, grantees engaged in their final year of program implementation with 100% of grantees reported using data to assess outcomes and impact of injury and violence prevention strategies, fulfilling CDC's target of 100% by 2015. A new Core SVIPP funding opportunity announcement (FOA) was awarded to 23 states in 2016. Starting in FY 2017, CDC adjusted its target to 95% to reflect possible shifts in the group of awardees under this new FOA (Measure 7.2.5).

Surveillance Performance Trends: The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)81 is a CDC collaboration with state and local public health agencies to collect and report data on approximately 100 diseases and conditions under continuous nationwide surveillance. NNDSS infrastructure is being modernized to more efficiently provide more comprehensive, timely, and higher quality data for public health decision making, enabling CDC programs to better monitor disease occurrence, identify potential outbreaks, recognize emerging trends, and monitor the impact of public health interventions. After developing and testing new Message Mapping Guides (MMG) for select conditions in 2014 and 2015, which transitioned data reporting to the HL7 message standards, CDC began receiving data for Arboviral diseases, including Zika infections, in October 2016. The new MMG enabled the process of submitting data to be fully automated. In early December 2016, the newly developed Message Validation, Processing and Provisioning System began to receive production data sent from the states using the new HL7-based messages. This system streamlines data processing, which will create a more efficient means for providing the data to CDC programs for analysis and action. The new system will allow the retirement of the older, less efficient legacy systems, and will increase the number of HL7 messages received at CDC. Three percent of notifiable disease messages were transmitted in HL7 format in FY 2016, a slight increase over the FY 2015 baseline, though not meeting the FY 2016 target (Measure 8.B.1.4). In support of the 2016 Zika virus response, resources for this project were diverted towards receiving, processing, and disseminating Arboviral disease data (i.e., Zika-related case notifications). Work on the originally scheduled HL7 messages has resumed and CDC anticipates meeting the FY 2017 target. Epidemiology Performance Trends: In FY 2016, CDC provided critical epidemiological data and recommendations for solving public health problems to over 278,000 clinicians, epidemiologists, laboratorians, and other public health professionals through an extensive network of electronic communication channels for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). During FY 2016, MMWR published 43 Zika reports, 42 as early releases. MMWR's electronic media reach, which includes web page views (www.cdc.gov/mmwr), subscriptions to MMWR content, and social media outlets has increased by three percent, from 22.4 million in FY 2014 to 23.1 million in FY 2016, a slight increase over FY 2015 and nearly meeting the target of 24.1 million (Measure 8.B.2.1a). CDC Vital Signs is a monthly science and communication program that targets the public, state and local health departments, health care professionals, and policymakers through a MMWR report, fact sheet, and print, broadcast, social, and electronic media (http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns). CDC recently found an artificial inflation in Vital Signs' electronic reach metrics occurring between April 2014  Nov 2015, resulting in an over count of 11% in FY 2014, 62% in FY 2015, and 7 percent in FY 2016. The revised metrics show that Vital Signs continues to exceed the goal of a 10% increase year-to-year, with a 27% increase from FY 2014  FY 2015, and 13% the following year (Measure 8.B.2.2). The Community Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force)82 is an independent, nonpartisan, nonfederal, unpaid panel of population health and prevention experts that generates evidence-based recommendations on programs and services that work to improve health and save money. In FY 2016, The Community Guide website, the primary dissemination tool for more than 220 Task Force recommendations, received 1,250,585 page views (Measure 8.B.2.5)--a four percent decrease from FY 2015, but an increase of about 35% over the 2011 baseline of 927,357 page views. In FY 2017, CDC aims to increase page views through the use of social media and other topical CDC web sites, such as the new Rural Health site, which highlights Community Guide in Action success

The Committee continues to strongly support the successful NDPP and directs all new funds provided in fiscal year 2016 and 2017 support an increase in the number of new competitively awarded program providers. Specifically, the focus should be on rural providers where the risk and burden of diabetes is greater, and where the program has the potential for the biggest impact. The Committee understands models exist for pairing the capacity of existing program providers with program delivery areas that lack sufficient resources to operate the program. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request on how these resources are being used for the provided purposes, how observable weight measure is being maintained, and how peer-reviewed science compares virtual providers to face to-face providers. The Committee requests CDC include long-term public health measures and how this program coordinates with other CDC and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs. The Committee also requests the total amount of Federal, public and private sector funds leveraged to support the NDDP annually in the fiscal year 2018 budget request and in future budget requests. (Page 44-55) CDC Response: CDC will provide a response to Congress for this Significant Item in a supplemental package. Obesity: The Committee continues support for the rural extension and outreach services program to support grants for rural counties with an obesity prevalence of over 40 percent. The Committee expects support for childhood obesity interventions based on scientific evidence to support measurable outcomes through evidenced- based obesity research, intervention, and prevention programs. The program should include a special focus on areas with the highest population-adjusted burden of obesity and with comorbidities like hypertension, cardiac disease and diabetes. The Committee understands the need to maximize impact of these funds, for this reason and to assure coordination with other activities, CDC should allocate maximum dollars to State programs. (Page 45) CDC Response: CDC will provide a response to Congress for this Significant Item in a supplemental package. Special Interest Projects (SIPs): The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request showing the steps taken to competitively award SIPs. The Committee continues to support CDC's important work on excessive drinking. However, the Committee notes the work on monitoring of youth exposure to alcohol advertising and the level of risk faced by youth from exposure to alcohol advertising may be duplicative with work ongoing in other Federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and NIH. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request on steps CDC is taking to reduce overlap and duplication in this area.

(Page 48) CDC Response: CDC will provide a response to Congress for this Significant Item in a supplemental package. Asthma: The Committee encourages CDC to explore methods to increase the number of States carrying out programmatic activities. The Committee encourages CDC to use a population-adjusted burden of disease criteria as a significant factor for new competitive awards. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2018 budget request detailing the competitive process. (Page 48) CDC Response: CDC will provide a response to Congress for this Significant Item in a supplemental package. Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program: The Committee understands HHS recommendations are based on evaluations conducted by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children with approved conditions compiled in a ``Recommended Uniform Screening Panel'' (RUSP). Most States screen for the overwhelming majority of the disorders listed on the RUSP but it can take several years for States to add new conditions. The Committee requests CDC provide an update in the fiscal year 2018 budget request on actions planned and on-going to work with States on ways to ensure screening of infants for diseases for which there is a preventable and/or effective treatment. Further, the update should note what steps can be taken to encourage States to adopt and implement new RUSP conditions within one year of their addition. (Page 48) CDC Response: CDC will provide a response to Congress for this Significant Item in a supplemental package. Vitamin D: The Committee is aware some epidemiological studies connect the lack of vitamin D to increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, breast cancer, and other diseases. In 2010, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that the recommended daily intakes of vitamin D supplements did not provide any health benefit other bone health. The Committee directs CDC to charter a National Academies of Sciences comprehensive study on the link between vitamin D and other health benefits of sun exposure; vitamin D supplements' efficacy compared to non-burning sunshine; and the issue of sunburns as the trigger for melanoma as opposed to non-burning sunshine. The report shall include recommendations for follow-on research where a lack of evidence is available and public health recommendations, if based on sound high quality peer-reviewed scientific evidence.
