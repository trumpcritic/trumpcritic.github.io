CDC will continue to strive to decrease syphilis cases among women, both to protect the health of women and to prevent congenital syphilis.

Each positive test in a child is considered a medical emergency with immediate health services follow-up. The absence of testing is often related to complete lack of, or late initiation of prenatal care. Between 2003 and 2004, the overall rate of congenital syphilis decreased 17.8 percent in the U.S., from 10.7 to 8.8 cases per 100,000 live births.

Vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, and other insects, account for 17 percent of the estimated global burden of all infectious diseases. The United States has seen an increase in the number and spread of vector-borne diseases. In the United States, the most common vector-borne diseases causing regular outbreaks include mosquito-borne West Nile and dengue viruses; tickborne Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever; and flea-borne plague. More vector-borne diseases continue to be discovered; in the last decade alone, CDC has discovered five new tickborne pathogens in the United States. The emergence and spread of the Zika virus is the latest and most notable viral vector-borne threat. Zika virus has spread to 64 countries and territories and is the only mosquito-borne arbovirus known to be sexually transmitted or to cause microcephaly and other associated severe birth defects in <a href='#' class='text-danger'>fetus</a>es. As of March 20, 2017, over 4,700 pregnant women living in the United States and its territories have evidence of being infected with Zika virus. The primary vectors of Zika, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, are widespread throughout the United States and its territories and have been found in an increasing number of locations in the last decade. They are also the primary vectors for the other important vector-borne viruses worldwide. Both species also transmit dengue and chikungunya. Aedes aegypti also transmits yellow fever. CDC's vector-borne diseases program is the focal point of our nation's capacity to detect, control, and prevent bacterial, rickettsial, and viral pathogens transmitted by ticks and insects. CDC's vector-borne scientists have deep expertise in entomology, microbiology, and public health that does not exist elsewhere. CDC experts work with and support state and local health departments directly during outbreak investigations; provide tools for outbreak preparedness and response; identify novel repellents and other prevention tools; and identify, improve, and deploy diagnostic tools and tests. CDC's core vector-borne disease activities in FY 2016-2017 included the following activities. Developing and supporting laboratory capacity to rapidly diagnose vector-borne diseases CDC supports domestic and international diagnostic laboratories by developing testing guidelines, distributing reagents and supplies, and performing confirmatory testing for difficult or complex cases. In addition, CDC develops new diagnostic methods to improve testing speed, accuracy, and reliability and provides training to domestic and international partners.
