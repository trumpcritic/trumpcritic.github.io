<p>
	Recently, the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.05dbd3781d24'>Washington Post revealed</a> that the Trump Administration chose to censor the CDC from using certain words to communicate their 
budgetary needs to Congress. This has caused an uproar across twitter as <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CDC7words'>#CDC7words</a> 
has become a trending topic.<br>
<br>
But what does this censorship actually mean for the CDC? How has the CDC used these words in the past? 
Will the CDC be able to communicate clearly regarding the complex clinical topics that it discusses in its budget proposals?
<br>
<br>
Figuring that out is pretty hard without doing some data mining. Each CDC Budget Justification document is hundreds of pages long, and there are more than 10 years worth of these documents to do through. So I wrote some code to automated the process of searching through the 10k+ pages, which is now <a href='https://github.com/trumpcritic/CDC7words'>available on github</a>. This website is automatically generated as result of that data mining. 
<br>
I believe this analysis shows the specific topics that justify how much the medical/scientific community is freaking out about this issue. For instance, this analysis clearly shows that not being able to say "transgendered" makes it difficult to discuss HIV-prevention and smoking-cessastion programs at the CDC, which specifically target the transgendered community. There is no other sensible word that can be used to replace "transgendered" in the context of HIV prevention, which amounts to the Trump administration deciding that the CDC does not get to discuss that HIV is a problem for the transgendered community in a different way than other communities. Those differences require the attention of both the CDC and Congress.<br>
No matter what you might think of transgendered rights, this is a very bad thing for everyones public health. HIV is a dangerous disease, and it is literally the CDC's job to figure out how these diseases are spread and sort out how to stop the spread of infection.o<br>
<br>
My point is this: This is not some twitter rant. This is a real problem for those who take an unbiased, non-partisan view of public health. And its not just me saying it. This is what the data below shows. See for yourself.
