<p>
	Recently, the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.05dbd3781d24'>Washington Post revealed</a> that the Trump Administration chose to censor the CDC from using certain words to communicate their 
budgetary needs to Congress. This has caused an uproar across twitter as <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CDC7words'>#CDC7words</a> 
has become a trending topic.<br>
<br>
But what does this censorship actually mean for the CDC? How has the CDC used these words in the past? 
Will the CDC be able to communicate clearly regarding the complex clinical topics that it discusses in its budget proposals?
<br>
<br>
Figuring that out is pretty hard without doing some data mining. Each CDC Budget Justification document is hundreds of pages long, and there are more than 10 years worth of these documents to do through. So I wrote some code to automated the process of searching through the 10k+ pages, which is now <a href='https://github.com/trumpcritic/CDC7words'>available on github</a>. This website is automatically generated as result of that data mining. 
<br>
<br>
Using this tool, you can see for yourself how difficult it is going to be for the CDC to communicate clearly with Congress without the use of these terms, which have specific clinical meanings that matter for CDC strategy. 
<br><br>
It is not all bad news. While some of these terms are used constantly to reveal facts about clinical topics that would be hard to describe without them. The word "vulnerable" is not been previously used by the CDC in these documents. (although I did not search for synonyms or even different words with the same root, like "vulnerability", and I also did not do 
<a href='https://www.google.com/?q=site:cdc.gov%20vulnerable'>a comprehensive search</a> for uses of this term at the CDC, but outside these documents)
. This does not mean "vulnerable" is not an important clinical term, it just means that the CDC should be able to discuss funding intelligently without using the term.
